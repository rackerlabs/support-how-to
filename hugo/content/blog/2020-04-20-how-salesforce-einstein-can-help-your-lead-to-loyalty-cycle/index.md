Salesforce&reg; has long been a leader when it comes to industry developments. One of the latest, most promising
innovations is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to oversee business interactions. [By 2020, 85% of people](https://hbr.org/2016/06/why-salespeople-need-to-develop-machine-intelligence)
are expected to use AI to oversee business interactions. Salesforce [released Einstein](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2016/09/introducing-salesforce-einstein.html),
its AI platform, in 2016. The tool has been becoming more robust ever since.

Einstein AI technology goes beyond helping just a single
company department. It adds value across an entire business and its lead-to-loyalty cycle.

Here’s a look at how Salesforce Einstein can help at each stage along the way.

### Marketing: Personalize messaging and targeting

Marketing is about personalization, and Einstein quickly learns which product bundles and item
recommendations are most likely to change your lead from a casual window-shopper to a customer. Large companies
[like Netflix&reg;](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-do-netflixs-algorithms-work-machine-learning-helps-to-predict-what-viewers-will-like)
and Amazon&reg; already use AI to offer customers recommendations and suggested product systems.

AI-driven personalization has worked for the[Salesforce customer, Icebreaker](https://www.salesforce.com/customer-success-stories/icebreaker/).
This New Zealand-based company crafts clothing from merino wool. Icebreaker uses Einstein product recommendations and
creates personalized search category pages. Icebreaker learned that customers click these recommendations 40% more often,
leading to an 11% overall increase in average order value.

### Sales: Gauge prospect sentiment and score leads

Gauging the sentiment of customers and prospects is an essential task for a sales team member. When talking with dozens
of prospective customers, prioritizing positive leads and sales questions can be a challenge. Companies are mired with incredible amounts of
data, but often lack true information. With Einstein, the important insights rise to the top.

Einstein Sentiment analyzes a short snippet of text&mdash;like an email reply or sales inquiry&mdash;and classifies the exchange as
positive, negative, or neutral. It then prioritizes sales messages in a faster and more knowledgeable way. The software continues
learning as it analyzes more text samples, consistently becoming better at classifying the sentiment of a given text snippet.

Einstein also uses [predictive lead scoring](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/datasheets/sales-cloud-einstein-leadscoring.pdf)
to rank whether leads are likely to convert. It looks at factors like past deals and your historical sales data&mdash;so
your sales team knows where to best direct their efforts. Einstein continuously
improves its predictions, finding new insights in your latest sales data and showing you how it calculates those insights. This capability
gives your sales team an easy way to sift through mountains of data and prioritize the leads that are most likely to close.

### Fulfillment: Filter customer information and manage supply

Einstein can do more than just close deals with your prospects, it also helps you delight your
consumers after winning the deal. After a lead becomes a customer, your fulfillment team is responsible for
delivering on your company’s promise. Whether your offering includes a product, service, or both, your fulfillment team’s challenges
revolve around filtering and organizing a massive amount of customer information and managing supply. Einstein analyzes the status
information of a customer from an order and supply chain perspective. It can then filter those pieces of data appropriately, and
flag data points that are trending the wrong way for the Sales and Customer service departments. This capability lets your team prioritize and address fulfillment
issues before they escalate.

Einstein can even assist with supply management. Einstein Vision lets companies streamline
inventory management. For example, [Coca-Cola&reg; uses Einstein](https://diginomica.com/salesforce-captures-the-limits-of-ai-in-a-coca-cola-cooler)
by uploading a photograph of a display cabinet and training the software
to recognize when the stock of a certain soda was running low. The software places orders to restock supply based on images,
as opposed to having an employee look at the stock, count it, and manually enter the order into a system.

You could apply the same technology to manufacturing shelves, clothing stores, and more&mdash;to improve business processes and efficiency.

### Service: Gauge customer sentiment about your business

Like the sales stage, the service stage is all about gauging a customer’s sentiment. That’s where Einstein Intent, the complement to Einstein Sentiment,
comes into play.

Einstein Intent lets you to take a longer piece of a text document, like an email or article, and pull out certain types of information.
By programming the tool to crawl online review pages or customer feedback emails, your business can extract valuable information&mdash;like whether a message is
positive or negative, who is providing that feedback, and other preprogrammed details. Your service team can then use this information to improve long-term customer service
without manually reviewing every single document.

### Finance: Protect against fraud

Einstein can even help in the finance department as an advanced tool for fraud detection. Today, many leading companies and banks are turning to
[more robust AI tools](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/11/lloyds-uses-google-backed-ai-to-detect-phone-fraudsters.html) that use machine learning
to constantly adapt and protect a company’s system from increasingly complex online
fraud. Einstein gives [small businesses equal access](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/overview/) to the fraud protection measures that larger companies pay millions to obtain.

### If you have Salesforce, you’re ready to use Einstein

Einstein’s impressive AI capabilities bring benefits to all departments of your business. The best part is that Salesforce customers already
have access to Einstein&mdash;all you need to do is enable this integration for your business with your own licensing key. As a full-service
partner, Rackspace can help you do this by weaving Einstein into your existing business process to help get the most out of
your AI technology at every stage of your lead-to-loyalty cycle.
