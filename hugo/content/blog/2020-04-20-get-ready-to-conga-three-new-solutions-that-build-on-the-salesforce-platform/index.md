Conga is best known for its document generation solution. With Conga, you can create complicated documents like contracts, well-formatted Excel&reg; files, or simple quotes from your Salesforce&reg; data. However, Conga continues to evolve its product suite with the addition of three new solutions: Contracts, Sign, and ActionGrid. All three are strong additions to the Conga suite, and all aim to more efficiently organize, simplify, and automate data document generation.

### Conga Contracts: Speed up the contract negotiation process

This scenario might sound familiar. You know that Salesforce helps to streamline daily activities and can increase your sales, but everything is getting bogged down in the contract management lifecycle. Your sales reps reach out to legal to make amendments or get approval. This process can be tedious and time-consuming, especially when you are almost done. Conga Contracts can help.

Conga Contracts gives customers the ability to send a contract for negotiation, redline, and compare changes all within Salesforce. Solutions like Conga Contracts can help equip your team and speed up the contract negotiation process&mdash;resulting in more closed deals.

### Conga Sign: Capture signatures quickly

With Conga Sign, you can send and receive signatures in minutes and automatically store signed documents. Automate contract execution, follow the status of your documents, and easily track customers’ signing progress. Streamline your sales workflow and improve the customer-facing experience with Conga Sign.

### Conga ActionGrid: Actionable views into Salesforce data

The Sales team reviews their forecasts at the end of each week to ensure that management is addressing every deal correctly. Sales operations must create a specific output at the end of each call, typically taking hours or even the entire weekend to verify the output is correct and formulated correctly.

With Conga ActionGrid, sales operations can quickly change the data in their reports, including mass updates, multifilter, formulas, batch actions, and conditional formatting, even while on a call. After the data is updated and paired with the power of Conga Composer, sales reps can export each report with the click of a button.

### Consider Conga

Conga now offers various [certification programs](https://support.conga.com) to help recognize leaders in the industry. In a competitive market, there is no better way to add value to clients than by keeping up to date with new tools and technology. Maintaining certifications ensures that Rackspace knows how to leverage Salesforce strategically to improve client processes, and focus on the Process First. Technology Second.® methodology. Rackspace values certifications, and now has many consultants across all regions with Conga Composer, Conga ActionGrid, and Conga Contract certifications.
