### Introduction

The Hyperion Smart View Microsoft Excel add-on tool is a basic and important tool
for all users of Hyperion. This tool is used to load data into Hyperion, to view
data, and to access reports and webforms that have already been loaded into or
created in Hyperion.

One of the most common issues that is faced by end users is that they are not
able to connect to Hyperion Essbase or Hyperion Planning by using Smart View
after they have migrated or upgraded their current servers. This issue is caused
by the change to the server name after migration or an upgrade.

### Smart View connections

The Smart View Excel addon offers the following connection types:

- **Shared Connections**: Connections that are defined by an administrator and
that can be viewed by all users.

- **Private Connections**: Locally stored connections or URL-based connections.

The following diagram shows the two connection types:

In most cases, you find all your connections under **Shared Connections**.

If a data source is not listed under **Shared Connections**, you can use the
*quick connect* feature in **Private Connections**. Type a URL in the drop-down
box and click **GO**.

If you have a connection that you use all the time, add it to the list of
private connections and it will always be available in the drop-down list as an
option. Any URLs that you type are stored. When you click on a connection, you
get a context sensitive list of key actions that you can perform on that
connection.

After you use a connection a few times, you can access that connection from the
home panel by finding it in the **Recently Used** list. Most Recently Used (MRU)
items are great for single-click access to your most common tasks, such as
starting an ad-hoc analysis or opening a form. You can pin MRUs so that they
are always where you expect them to be.

### Create shared connections

To create a shared connection, perform the following steps:

1.	From the Smart View ribbon, click **Panel**.
2.	In the Smart View panel, click the arrow next to home as shown in the
following image and select **Shared Connections**.
3.	Log in by using a user ID and a password.

### Create private connections

By using private connections, you can connect to Hyperion Essbase, Planning, HSF,
OBIEE, reporting analysis, and HFM.

If you know the URL, you can create a private connection from a connection that
is not listed in **Shared Connections**. To add a connection by using a URL,
perform the following steps:

1.	From the Smart View ribbon, click **Panel**.
2.	In the Smart View panel, click the arrow next to the home as shown in the
following image and select **Private Connections**.

storage directory, for the data source to which you want to connect and click
<b>Next</b>. If you are unsure which URL to use, contact your system administrator
for the URL. The following list includes many of the most common URLs:
