Rackspace offers predefined design patterns from which clients can select for
business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) purposes.

<!--more-->

We provide the design patterns as a courtesy to our Sitecore&reg; Managed Cloud
Premium customers who use standard Platform as a Service (PaaS) deployments for
Sitecore Experience Platform (XP) and Sitecore Experience Manager (XM). The
patterns do not provide an end-to-end BC/DR solution, nor are they a Disaster
Recovery as a Service option. However, we offer design patterns that have been
tested and validated in association with the Rackspace Application Services (RAS)
Sitecore Product team. For each design pattern, Rackspace provides detailed steps
and determines which party is responsible for each step.

The detailed DR patterns enable both Azure&reg; Support and RAS Sitecore Support
to assist Sitecore Managed Cloud Premium customers who use the standard PaaS
deployments for XP and XM environments. If you use these environments, we can
consult with you on DR preparation and creating a detailed DR plan. Because we
have tested these patterns, we provide peace of mind that, in the event of a
disaster, we can effectively and efficiently recover the customers’ production
environment.

Sitecore Managed Cloud Premium customers who are using the following production
environments can opt in to these DR design patterns and runbooks:
