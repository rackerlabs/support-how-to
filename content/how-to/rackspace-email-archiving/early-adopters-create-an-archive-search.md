archive. This article describes the steps for creating an archive search in the Archive Manager.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 10 minutes
- **Tools required:** Archive Portal access

### Create an archive search

Use the following instructions to create an archive search:

1. Log in to the [Archive Manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f).

   For more information, see [Log in to the Archive Manager](/support/how-to/log-in-to-the-archive-manager).

2. On the left side of the screen, click **Search**.

3. Click the **+New** tab.

   **Note**: This function is available for users with **Administrator**, **Compliance Officer**, and **Search Administrator** permissions only.

4. Click the **Simple** or **Advanced** search tab.

   - **Simple**: Search for keywords, sender(from), recipient (to, cc, bcc), date, attachment, size, and hold.
   - **Advanced**: Search by sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachment with greater fine-tuning control. For more information, see the **Advanced search** section below.

5. Enter the search terms, and then click **Search**.

6. After the search results are returned, click **Save**.

7. Fill out the **Basic Information** section and click **Save**.

   **Note**: Only a **Search Name** is required to proceed.

   In this section, you can designate users to have access to the search.


### Advanced search

Sometimes a search might require additional search criteria. In these cases, it is often best to use the **Advanced** option. The more specific the information you give, the better and more accurate the results are.
