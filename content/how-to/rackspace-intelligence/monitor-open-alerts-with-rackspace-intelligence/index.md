Open alerts report statuses that you have asked Rackspace Intelligence
to monitor but not
[suppress](/support/how-to/work-with-notification-suppressions-in-rackspace-intelligence).

You can view a list of all open alerts by clicking **Monitor** at the top of the
Rackspace Intelligence interface and then clicking **Open Alerts**.

You can sort the list of open alerts based on the names of entities or alarms,
the status of alarms, and the time each alarm was triggered.

Sorting by status groups the most serious alarms together, which can help you
prioritize responses. Sorting by time reports the history of alarms in
chronological or reverse-chronological order, which can help you investigate
causes and effects.

You can also export the list of open alerts in CSV format suitable for further
analysis. To export the list of open alerts as in CSV format,
click the **Export as CSV** link and then follow the required steps to
save the file.
