Rackspace Intelligence monitors the performance and availability of
infrastructure and, when limits are exceeded, can respond by [notifying](/support/how-to/working-with-rackspace-intelligence-notification-plans) or
[suppressing a notification](/support/how-to/work-with-notification-suppressions-in-rackspace-intelligence).

When you [log in to Rackspace Intelligence](/support/how-to/logging-in-to-the-rackspace-intelligence-dashboard),
you can view all your relevant information on the dashboard:

The dashboard provides an overview of all of your monitoring activities.

You can also examine different aspects of Rackspace Intelligence
configuration to monitor your system by accessing the following sections
from the header:

- **Monitor**
- **Suppress**
- **Notify**
- **Visualize**

Within each section, you can refine your focus by choosing from the
offerings in the section. For example, in the **Monitor** section, you can
choose to work
with [entities](/support/how-to/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence) or [open alerts](/support/how-to/monitoring-open-alerts-with-rackspace-intelligence).

In some areas of the interface, the **Actions** menu is available. For example,
if you [create an entity](/support/how-to/monitoring-entities-with-rackspace-intelligence#create-entities)
in the **Monitor** section and provide basic information about it, the **Entity
Details** page contains an **Actions** menu. You can use the menu commands to
rename, define an IP address, delete it, and create checks or
suppressions for the entity.

By understanding the structure of these sections in the Rackspace
Intelligence interface, you can predict where to find the information
and tools you need.
