Rackspace Intelligence monitors the availability of your IT infrastructure and,
when limits are exceeded, can respond by notifying someone.

When you log in to [Rackspace Intelligence](/support/how-to/log-in-to-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts),
you can view all your relevant information on the dashboard:

The dashboard provides an overview of all of your monitoring activities.

You can also examine different aspects of the Rackspace Intelligence
system monitoring configuration by accessing the following sections from the
header:

- **Monitor**
- **Notify**
- **Visualize**

Within each section, you can refine your focus by choosing from the offerings in
that section. For example, in the **Monitor** section, you can choose to work
with entities or open alerts.

Customers with dedicated accounts can use Rackspace Intelligence to view
information about the following items:

- Entities monitored by Rackspace Intelligence
- Open alerts
- Checks
- Notifications
- Notification plans

You can also use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to [view and generate graphs to visualize infrastructure availability](/support/how-to/viewing-and-creating-graphs-of-activity-in-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts).

**Note** Customers with dedicated accounts cannot use Rackspace Intelligence to
create or edit entities, alarms, checks, notifications, and notification plans.
