To tell Rackspace Intelligence which aspects of your configuration to monitor
for you, define your objectives in the following terms:

-   *Entities* to be monitored

    For example, you can define a cloud server as an entity.

-   *Checks* that focus on a particular aspect of an entity's behavior

    For example, a check can monitor a cloud server's RAM usage.

-   *Alarms* that define the limits of the entity's behavior

    For example, alarm criteria identify whether RAM usage is in one of
    the following states: `OK`, `WARNING`, or `CRITICAL`.

-   *Alerts* that announce when a monitored entity has triggered an
    alarm

    For example, an alert reports that RAM usage has reached the
    CRITICAL level.

-   *Notification plans* that define how to communicate alerts

    For example, a notification plan requests notification of the help
    desk and the on-call system administrator.

-   *Notifications* that define the contact information used in
    notification plans

    For example, the system sends notifications to the on-call system
    administrator as text messages to a specific telephone number.

-   *Visualizations* that present data meaningfully

    For example, a RAM usage graph shows growth leading up to the
    triggered alarm.
