Rackspace Intelligence provides a set of predefined graphs that show the activity of all
the metrics and checks that have been defined for your monitoring entities. 

If you want to explore a metric across multiple entities, consider using
custom graphs. For more information, see [Creating custom graphs of activity in Rackspace Intelligence](/how-to/creating-custom-graphs-of-activity-in-rackspace-intelligence).

### View basic graphs

To view the predefined graphs that are available to you, click **Visualize** at the top
of the interface, and then click **Basic Graphs**.

To view any of the default graphs for your entities, click
**Rackspace Default** under **Graph Collections**.

To view a graph for a specific check, in the **Graphs by Check**
section, click the name of the check for which you want to see the
graphs, such as **CPU**.

A list of graphs are displayed that are available for your check.

### Work with favorites

Rackspace Intelligence lets you specify one or more favorite graphs and
filter for your favorites.

To mark a graph as favorite, click the star icon to the left of the
title of the graph.

To filter for your favorite graphs, click **Favorites** under **Graph
Collections.**

### Specify a time range

Rackspace Intelligence lets you use preset or custom time ranges for the
data that is collected and displayed in graphs.

If you choose a preset time range, Rackspace Intelligence shows data
collected for the entity during the most recent period of that range:

-   One hour
-   Eight hours
-   One day
-   One week
-   One month

If you choose a custom time range and click **Apply**, Rackspace
Intelligence shows data collected for the entity between the first and
last time stamp.

### Adjust the layout of your graph page

You can adjust the way your graphs are displayed on the page by selecting one of
the display icons on the top-right corner of the page. You can choose to display graphs
side-by-side in a grid or display them in a linear sequence. 

The following example shows a grid layout:
