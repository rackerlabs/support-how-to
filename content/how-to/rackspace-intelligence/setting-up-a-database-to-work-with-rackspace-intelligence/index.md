You can use Rackspace Intelligence to help you observe the status of your
database if you set up the database to be visible to Rackspace Intelligence. You
can do this through the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/) by
following these steps:

1. Create a database. For instructions on creating a database at the
    command-line by using the trove client, see [Create a database instance by using the trove client](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-databases/v1/developer-guide/#create-a-database-instance-by-using-the-trove-client).

2. Establish monitoring checks and alarms for the database as described in
    [Monitoring Cloud Databases in the Cloud Control Panel](/support/how-to/monitoring-cloud-databases-in-the-cloud-control-panel).
