Everyone who has a Rackspace cloud account can use the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/)
to create and manage devices and the
[https://intelligence.rackspace.com](https://intelligence.rackspace.com/)
to observe infrastructure status.

As you create new servers and databases with your cloud account, Rackspace
Intelligence automatically recognizes them as entities. By taking some extra
steps, you can enable Rackspace Intelligence to give you full information on the
status of those entities.

If you explicitly define something other than a cloud server or cloud database
as an entity, Rackspace Intelligence can also monitor its status.

### Begin monitoring a cloud server

To view all relevant data, you should [install the Cloud Monitoring agent](/support/how-to/install-and-configure-the-rackspace-monitoring-agent) on
any cloud server that you want to monitor with Rackspace Intelligence.
[Setting up a server to work with Rackspace Intelligence](/support/how-to/set-up-a-server-to-work-with-rackspace-intelligence)
shows how to install the agent on a cloud server and how that
server appears to Rackspace Intelligence before and after you install the agent.

### Begin monitoring a cloud database

[Setting up a database to work with Rackspace Intelligence](/support/how-to/setting-up-a-database-to-work-with-rackspace-intelligence)
shows how to define the characteristics of a database for Rackspace Intelligence monitoring.
