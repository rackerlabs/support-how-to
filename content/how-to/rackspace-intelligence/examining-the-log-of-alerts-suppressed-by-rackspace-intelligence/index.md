You can use the **Suppressed Alerts** log to review alerts that were muted but
ordinarily would have prompted notifications.

It is good practice to check the **Suppressed Alerts** list after a suppression
period ends to confirm that all suppressed alerts relate to the
purpose of the suppression. For example, if the system suppressed device alerts during a
scheduled maintenance period, you should investigate alerts related to servers that you did
not expect the maintenance to disrupt.

To learn more about an entity, notification plan, or suppression in the log,
click its name. If it has not been deleted, you can see the detailed
description.
