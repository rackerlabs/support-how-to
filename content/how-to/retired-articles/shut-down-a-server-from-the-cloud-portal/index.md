This article describes how to shut down a Rackspace Cloud Server.

**IMPORTANT:** Because Cloud Server pricing is based on the hours that the server uses resources on the
host machine, shutting down a server is not enough to stop billing. To completely prevent any further
charges incurred from this server, you must delete it.

### Shut down the server

1. Log in to the [Cloud Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/).

2. Under the **Select Product** menu, navigate to **Rackspace Cloud**.

3. Navigate to **Servers** > **Cloud Servers**.

4. Click on the gear icon next to the server and select **Shutdown Server...**.

5. In the pop-up dialog box, select **Shutdown Server**.

**Note:** After initiating the shutdown, allow three to five minutes for the status to change from `Active`.
