    require 'rubygems'
    require 'cloudfiles'
    # Log in to the Cloud Files system
    cf = CloudFiles::Connection.new('UsernameGoesHere','APIKeyGoesHere')
    #Create a Container
    container = cf.create_container('ContainerNameGoesHere')
    #Create an Object
    object = container.create_object('ObjectNameGoesHere')
    # Write Data to an Object
    object.write('DataGoesHere')
