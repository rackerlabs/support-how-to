The SharePoint service provides 250 MB of storage at no charge. When you
are ready to upgrade, you can do so in 1 GB increments in the Cloud Office Control
Panel.

To upgrade SharePoint storage, [log in to the Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com), and perform the following steps:

1. At the top of the page, click the **Add Storage** link under **Microsoft SharePoint**.

  

2. In the **Quantity** field, enter the integer amount of additional storage that you want. Your current monthly rate, your new monthly rate, and the prorated charges display in the **Summary** section.

    

3. Click **Review Order**.

4. Review the upgrade details and billing information. To update billing information, click **Edit**.

5. Click **Complete Order**.

    **Note:** Prorated charges will appear on your next bill.
