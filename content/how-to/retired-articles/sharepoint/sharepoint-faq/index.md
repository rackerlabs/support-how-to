### Account Services

#### How can I determine the Cloud Office system status?

For Cloud Office system status verification, use the following
link: [Cloud Office system status](https://status.apps.rackspace.com/).

### Sharepoint

#### Do I need to make the site a trusted site in Internet Explorer?

Yes, several SharePoint features will not function properly until your
site's URL has been added to your "trusted sites" in Internet Explorer.

#### Can I use PerformancePoint services?

Unfortunately, Business Intelligence features (such as PerformancePoint)
are not currently available in a shared environment. However, these
features are included in the SharePoint Server 2013 Enterprise edition
and are supported in a [dedicated SharePoint
environment](https://sharepoint.rackspace.com/dedicated-sharepoint).

#### Can I use Office Web Apps?

Office Web Applications (OWA) functionality is not available. This
functionality was removed to comply with Microsoft's licensing terms.

We are exploring possible options to be able to add OWA back to this
environment but there is no time table for a resolution. It should be
noted that OWA is still available for other hosted SharePoint solutions
at Rackspace. If you agree with us in thinking this is an
anti-competitive move on Microsoft's part, we encourage you to speak to
your Microsoft account representatives and let them know.
