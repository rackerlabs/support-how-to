If you're a VAT-registered business or organization, in most cases you can reclaim the value-added tax (VAT) that you pay when you buy goods and services for your business. To reclaim this money, you must have records to support your claim. By collecting your VAT ID number, Rackspace can correctly prepare an invoice for your records.

If you're not a VAT-registered business or organization, you can't reclaim the VAT that you pay when you buy goods and services.
