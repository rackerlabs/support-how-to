The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your total
cloud expense by splitting the cost of infrastructure and support. The support
cost, or "Service Level Rate", is determined by the total Compute power used.
The infrastructure rate is based on the amount of gigabytes (GB) of random
access memory (RAM) used during the billing cycle, and not on the types of
server. This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger servers.

### What is the Service Level Rate?

The Service Level Rate covers maintenance and support of all your cloud Compute
products (such as servers). It is based upon your service level. OnMetal servers
have a flat hourly rate independent of RAM. If you do not meet the minimum
Service Level Rate during your billing cycle, the difference is assessed to your
account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but the Service Level Rate is
only assessed against Compute products. Storage services such as Cloud Files and
Cloud Block Storage have no Service Level Rates associated with them.
