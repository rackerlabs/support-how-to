1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).
2. In the Rackspace Email section, click **Mobile Sync**.
3. On the Mobile Sync page, select the users to activate by selecting the check box next to the user email adress, or you can select **Add Mobile Sync to all mailboxes on this domain**
4. Click **Save**.
