Businesses have several choices when it comes to their IT infrastructure, including do-it-yourself (DIY), traditional colocation, [cloud computing](https://www.rackspacecloud.com/), and [managed hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting). Because there are so many offerings on the market, the decision-making process can be overwhelming.

As a business leader, it's important for you to determine which solution works best for your business's strategy and needs. [Managed Colocation](https://www.rackspace.com/dedicated-servers/colocation), one such infrastructure option, is the hosting choice of many businesses because it provides the desired level of control while offloading some of the inconvenience, financial risk, and upfront capital. Managed Colocation means that businesses don't need to fund, build, or maintain their own data centers, and the business is not responsible for creating their own high performance, robust network. Instead businesses that chose Managed Colocation take advantage of Rackpsace's professional facilities, and networks and have access to other services and managed solutions.

Businesses that choose Managed Colocation often have similar concerns:

> *"I already have a great staff that understands our applications and
operating systems, but I don't want to burden them with the day-to-day
management of servers and networking devices."*

Technical directors who want to retain full administrative control of
their environment but don't want to manage the infrastructure often
choose Managed Colocation. It allows their staff to add value in their
key areas of expertise without burdening them with everyday server
management. And while your experts are adding unique IT value to your
business, our experts will manage the tedious break/fixes.

> *"I like the control of managing my infrastructure myself, but there
are a lot of continuously moving parts that distract me from my core
business."*

Managed Colocation offers simplicity. Managing all the vendors and agents who are involved in traditional
colocation can be overwhelming and time consuming. With Rackspace
Managed Colocation you have a single point of contact who is an expert
at managing the tactical side of your IT infrastructure.

> *"I'm concerned about the operational and financial risks potentially
involved with choosing a hosting provider versus managing servers
in-house."*

The Managed Colocation hosting option offers limited financial risk
compared to a DIY solution. Upfront costs can be reallocated to other
business differentiators, and operations can be fully focused on driving
innovation. With your technicians managing the operating system and
mission-critical applications, you are still able to maintain the desired
level of control. And because the provider handles the infrastructure, you
no longer have to commit to a large capital outlay simply to have that
level of control. An important consideration, however, is the
Service Level Agreement that your provider offers. An aggressive
SLA, such as those that Rackspace offers, will give you further peace of
mind when it comes to mitigating risk.

### Which industries choose Managed Colocation?

[Managed Colocation](https://www.rackspace.com/dedicated-servers/colocation)
has varied clients in a number of different business markets. Some
examples are:

-   Ecommerce
-   SaaS
-   Advertising
-   Media
-   IT consulting

> *"I need help managing my growing IT footprint."*

One of the many benefits of Managed Colocation is that you are provided
with a team that can provide consultation around space planning and
growth. Because the provider is responsible for the data center, they
also help manage and plan for your growth needs and deployments.

> *"We want to transition from a total in-house scenario. Colocation is
the logical first step, but I need some help."*
