### Manage public folders

You can manage public folders through email clients on both Windows and
Mac. Following are instructions for managing public folders through
Outlook and Entourage.

#### Outlook 2003, 2007, 2010

1. Open Outlook and log in to your email account.

2. In the navigation pane, click **Folder List**.

3. Expand **Public Folders > All Public Folders**, the root
   folder, and your domain.

#### Outlook 2011 for Mac

1. Open Outlook 2011 and log in to your email account.

2. From the **Tools** menu, select **Public Folders**.

3. Within the folder browser, select the root folder and your domain.

#### Entourage 2008

1. Open Entourage and log in to your email account.

2. In the navigation pane, expand **Public Folders > All Public
   Folders**, the root folder, and finally your domain.

### Add to your public folders and assign permissions

Following are instructions for creating additional public folders and
assigning permissions, as needed.

#### Create a public folder

1.  Follow the steps in the preceding section to access your
    public folders.

2.  Right-click on your domain and select **New Folder**.

#### Assign permissions to a public folder

**Note:** You might see a few groups on the **Permissions** tab, and
that is normal. It is important to leave these groups intact so that we
can help you if you need help. There are also two special groups
called **FolderAdmins** and **FolderUsers**. These groups allow you to
set permissions for all of your public folder administrators or users at
once.

1. Follow the steps in the preceding section to access your public
   folders.

2. Right-click the public folder and select **Properties**.

3. Click the **Permissions** tab.

4. Click **Add**, select the member to whom you want to grant
   permission, and then click **Add** again.

5. Select the permission type that will work best for the user.

  For a list of available roles and permissions, see [Public folder permissions for Exchange](/support/how-to/public-folder-permissions-for-exchange).
