### Backing Up Your MySQL Database

1. Log in to the [online manager (phpMyAdmin)](/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-phpmyadmin-database-management-interface).

2. To view information, click on a database or table in the left frame.

3. To export the database to a backup file, click **Export**.


4. To save the backup file to your system, click **Save as
   file**.

   When you save the file, you can change the name of the backup file and the
   compression method, or use the defaults. Compression reduces the size of the backup file.
   The recommended compression method is *gzipped*.


5. To start the backup process, click **Go**.

6. When the backup process completes, follow the prompt to save the file to your desktop.
