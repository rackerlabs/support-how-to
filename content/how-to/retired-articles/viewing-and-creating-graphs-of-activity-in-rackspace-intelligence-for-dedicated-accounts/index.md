Rackspace Intelligence offers a variety of reporting options. Use the
predefined or custom graph options to generate an informative view of
your system's activity.

### Work with predefined graphs

Rackspace Intelligence provides predefined graphs that represent the
activity of any entity that you choose during any time range that you
choose. To see these graphs, click **Visualize** at the top of the
interface, and then click **Basic Graphs**.

If you choose a preset time range, Rackspace Intelligence shows data
collected for the entity during the most recent period of that range:

- One hour
- Eight hours
- One day
- One week
- One month

If you choose a custom time range and click **Apply**, Rackspace
Intelligence shows data collected for the entity between the first and
last time stamp.

### Work with custom graphs

You can customize your Rackspace Intelligence graphs by choosing how to
focus:

- Focus on a single metric, comparing it across multiple entities.
- Focus on a single entity, examining it with multiple metrics.

Click **Visualize** at the top of the interface, click **Custom
Graphs**, and then choose your focus.

#### Explore a metric

When you focus on a single metric, you can simultaneously view that
metric on any of the entities you have defined. For example, you can
choose to see the percentage of idle time for all your entities.

#### Explore an entity

When you focus on a single entity, you can simultaneously view any of
the metrics available for that entity. For example, you can choose to
see the entity's percentage of idle time and its maximum usage.

### Generate graphs

After you have selected the combination of entities and metrics that you
want to view, click **Generate Graphs**.

Rackspace Intelligence generates the graphs for the selected entities
and metrics. You can choose a preset time frame or create a customized
time frame for which you want the metrics to be generated.

- To change the values for your preset time frame, click one of the
  preset time ranges.
- To generate graphs for a custom time range, click **Custom**, select
  the appropriate date and time for the start and end dates, and then
  click **Apply**.

Rackspace applies the selected time range to display the graphs for your
selected checks.
