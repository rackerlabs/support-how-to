Rackspace Email is Rackspace's email service. We manage the
email service so you don't have to. Following are a few helpful sections on
how to get the most of your Rackspace Email experience.

### Group lists

A group list is a great way to manage users in a select team or group on
your domain. There is no limit to the number of internal address
(addresses within your domain) and a limit of 250 additional members
outside of the domain. For example, suppose that you have a billing team you want to
group together - bob@domain.com, amy@domain.com, and scott@domain.com. You
can create a group list for the team so that they can communicate new
upcoming billing updates within the team, at billingupdates@domain.com.

To set up a group list, follow the instructions in [Add a Rackspace Email group list](/support/how-to/adding-a-rackspace-email-group-list).

### Aliases

Aliases are a way to create an alternate name for an existing mailbox.
For example, John likes to go by Johnny and would like to receive emails to both
John@domain.com, for business partners, and Johnny@domain.com, for
friends and family, without checking two different accounts.

To setup an alias, follow the instructions in [Add an alias with Rackspace Email](/support/how-to/adding-an-alias-with-rackspace-email).

### Webmail

Webmail is a direct connection to your email without the need of
additional software. Messages that are sent and received using Webmail will be
waiting for you the next time you log into the portal. The Webmail
portal provides most of the same functionality a mail client would offer,
from sending and receiving email to setting up email signatures and even
setting up email forwarding to your personal email accounts.

Webmail has the following advantages over using a mail client:

- You do not need to configure additional server settings for Webmail.
- Email is ready to access 24x7 through the most popular web browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari).
- Messages are stored in the cloud so no local storage is consumed.

To access the Webmail portal, go to <https://apps.rackspace.com>.
