Once you have learned how to [Create a new Cloud Server](/how-to/create-a-cloud-server),
you may use several of our tools that allow control over your server.

-   [Reboot Server](/how-to/reboot-your-server)
-   [Rebuild Server](/how-to/rebuild-a-cloud-server)
-   [Resize Server](/how-to/managing-your-server-resizing-standard-and-general-purpose-servers)
    (resize Standard Cloud Servers up or down and General Purpose Servers only up)
-   [Reset Password](/how-to/reset-your-server-password)
-   [Delete Server](/how-to/deleting-your-server)

To access these tools, begin by clicking on the hyperlinked name of your
server under the **Cloud Servers** section to take you to the **Cloud
Servers Overview** screen.  All of the administrative tools for Cloud
Servers are located in the **Overview** tab of your Cloud Server Detail
screen.
