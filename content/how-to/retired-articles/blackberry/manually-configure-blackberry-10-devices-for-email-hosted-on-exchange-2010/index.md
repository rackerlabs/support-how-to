The following steps are required to configure Microsoft Exchange 2010
ActiveSync on a Blackberry 10 Phone:

**Note:** A BES data plan must be purchased through your provider and
added to your account; your administrator will then purchase a [BES
license](/support/how-to/add-an-activesync-or-bes-license),
assign it to your email address, and provide you with an activation PIN.

1. Locate the **Settings** options from
   within your home menu.



2. Select **Accounts**.


3. Select **Advanced** from the bottom of the screen, or you may need to
   select the **Add Account** first if you already have an account set up.


4. Select **Microsoft&reg; Exchange ActiveSync**.



5. Enter your full Email Address, Server Address and Password for your
   account. Leave the Domain field blank and enter the following address
   for Server: **connect.emailsrvr.com**


   Leave all other settings at their defaults, then select **Next**.

   **Note:** Your username is the same as your email address.

6. Confirm which personal information you would like to sync from your
   Exchange mailbox to your Blackberry, then select **Done**.


7. Wait for your Blackberry to complete verifying your settings.


8. When this is complete, you will see your list of accounts as well as
   the new account that was set up.


9. To check for new messages swipe up from the bottom of the screen then
   to the right, and then select your mail account to view your inbox.
