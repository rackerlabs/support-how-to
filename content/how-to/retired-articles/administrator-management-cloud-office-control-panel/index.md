From the Administrators section of the control panel, you can manage your administrators' access and activity.

You can add multiple administrators with varying degrees of account access. There are Super, Standard, and Limited administrators. Limited administrators have access only to specifically assigned sections of the control panel. You can also monitor and export logs of all administrator logins and actions.

The following articles provide instructions for managing your administrators:
