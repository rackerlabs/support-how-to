Archiving collects and stores both external and internal incoming and
outgoing email, including attachments. This data can be accessed for
search and review by the administrator of the account and by
administrator-designated users.

To enable archiving, [log in to the Cloud Office Control
Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com), and perform the following steps:

1.  Click your account name in the upper-right corner, and select **Upgrades & Services**.
2.  On the **Upgrades & Services** tab, click the name of your domain.
4.  In the **Add-ons** section, click the **Email Archiving** menu and select
    **On**.
5.  Click **Continue**.
6.  Click **Complete Order**.

You will receive a welcome email from **mail@archivesrvr.com**. After
you receive the welcome email, all new email will start being copied
into the archive.

Messages will be indexed nightly for search purposes. To manually index
for immediate search access, click **Collect Now** in the **Collectors**
section of the Archive Manager.
