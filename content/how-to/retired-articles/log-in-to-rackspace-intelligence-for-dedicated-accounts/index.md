To use Rackspace Intelligence, you must have a dedicated Rackspace
customer account and you must be logged in to the
[MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com) for that account.
Rackspace Intelligence has no separate login process.

To access Rackspace Intelligence:

1.  Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/).
2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Dedicated Hosting**.
3.  Click **Services > Availability Monitoring**.

    This takes you to the **Entities** page, which lists all of your
    available entities. From this page, you can explore all the details
    for the entities that have been configured for you.

After you have launched the **Entities** page, you can explore different
features that pertain to your entities. For more information, see
[Working with alarms, checks, entities, notifications, and notification
plans in Rackspace Intelligence for dedicated
accounts](/support/how-to/working-with-alarms-checks-entities-notifications-and-notification-plans-in-rackspace)
and [Understanding the Rackspace Intelligence user interface for
