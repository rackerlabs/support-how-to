You can determine whether your server is a First Generation Cloud Server
in the following ways:

-   On the Cloud Servers page of the Cloud Control Panel, you can filter
    your server list in the left pane to list only First Generation
    servers.

-   In the list of servers on the Cloud Servers page, all First
    Generation servers are marked with a blue asterisk.
