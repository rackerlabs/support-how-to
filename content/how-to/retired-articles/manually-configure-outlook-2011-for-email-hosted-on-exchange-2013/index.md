6. Click **Add Account**.

7. Confirm that the amber-colored dot next to the account name turns from an amber
   color to a solid green color.

   {{<image src="green.png" alt="" title="">}}

   **Note:** The dot might take a minute or two to change from amber to green.
   If the dot doesn't change, check the account settings and password and
   ensure that you are using the correct EWS server address.

8. Close all windows.

If you already have email on the server, your email will slowly begin
to populate your inbox. This can take some time depending on how much
data you have.
