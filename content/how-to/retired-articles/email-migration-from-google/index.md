When you migrate your email from Google, it is important to note that
Google email does not use subfolders. Instead, Google categorizes
email by using *labels*. As a result, some migration services must
convert the Google labels into subfolders. When you use MigrationWiz
to migrate your email, the conversion happens seamlessly in the
background.

In addition to labels, Google has a folder called **All Mail**, which
contains a copy of every message in your mailbox. By default,
MigrationWiz migrates only archived email within the **All Mail**
folder.

**More items to note:**

-   After the migration, you might see a new folder called **All
    Mail**. The view and folder structure will be similar to that
    in Google.
-   The size of the email account might be larger because of the **All
    Mail** folder.
