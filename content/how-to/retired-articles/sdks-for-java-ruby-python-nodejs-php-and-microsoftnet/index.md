You can download the language-specific software development kits (SDKs)
for Cloud Files from the [Rackspace Developer website](https://docs.rackspace.com/#home-sdks).
This site includes links to the SDKs for the following languages:

-   Java
-   Microsoft .NET
-   Node.js
-   PHP
-   Python
-   Ruby

In addition to links to the SDKs, this site provides links to reference
materials, sample code, and tips on how to use each SDK.

### Using Git

Some of the SDK instructions use the Git version control system. The
documentation for each SDK assumes that you have Git installed and
configured on your local machine. For more information about Git, see
the Git website for UNIX or Linux or for Windows.

### Downloading an SDK

To download an SDK, follow the instructions on the SDK's web page. In
general, you run a git clone command with the URL of the repository that
you want to get as an argument. Because the clone operation downloads
the files to your current directory, you should create an empty
directory to hold the files before performing the download.
