Cloud Block Storage offers both a low cost per gigabyte option with standard performance for customers who only require more storage and a high performance option that provides increased storage with higher performance.

Highlights of Rackspace Cloud Block Storage include:

-  A high performance option for databases and high performance applications, leveraging solid state drives for speed.
-  A standard speed option for customers who just need additional storage on their Cloud Server.

Two simple price options:

-  Lower cost per GB for standard performance and additional storage.
-  Higher cost per GB for high performance and additional storage.
