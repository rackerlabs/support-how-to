This article describes how to install the desktop Office 365 suite and set up Exchange Online mailboxes within the Outlook for Windows client for the first time.

### Install Office Applications, including Outlook, on a Windows device

**Note:** If you are unsure whether your license includes the Office suite, contact your administrator.

1. Navigate to [office.com](office.com) in the web browser of your choice. Click **Sign In** and enter your
email address and password when prompted.

2. In the upper right-hand corner, click **Install Office** and select **Install Premium Office 365 Apps**.

3. When the download completes, run the installer.

4. If prompted, allow the Office installer to make changes to your device.

5. After the installation completes, click **Close**.

6. Open the **Start** menu and navigate to **Outlook**.

7. Open Outlook and click **Accept** when prompted to *Accept the license agreement*.

8. Click **Next** when prompted with the message, *Microsoft respects your privacy*.

9. When prompted to *Allow my organization to manage my device*, select one of the following options:

      - **This app only** – Your organization will not have access to your Outlook desktop app and may impose security policies for Outlook.

      - **Yes** – This registers your devices within your organization and allows your organization to impose security policies for Outlook.


### Configure your Microsoft 365 Exchange Online mailbox within Outlook

**Note:** If Outlook automatically recognizes the mailbox associated with your licensed Office 365 user during initial setup,
skip the following steps.

8. After successfully signing in, select **No, sign in to this app only** if prompted, then click **Finish**.

9. Once the new profile has been created, click **Always use this profile**, then select the newly created profile.

10. Click **Apply**, then **OK** to complete the Outlook mail profile setup.
