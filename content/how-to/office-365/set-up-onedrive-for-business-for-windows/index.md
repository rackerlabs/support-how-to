### OneDrive Sync Status Icons


OneDrive for Business displays various **Sync Status** icons for each file or folder. Refer to the information below for
a brief description of the basic **Sync Status** icons:

**Blue Cloud:**

files do not take up any additional storage space on your device.


**Green Tick (White Circle):**

- The **Green Tick** indicates that a file is **Locally available**. When you open an **online-only** file for the first time, the
system downloads it as a **locally available** file that you can access regardless of network connectivity.

- You can revert **locally available** files to **online-only** files by **right-clicking** the file and selecting **Free up space**.


**Solid Green Circle (White Tick):**

- The **Solid Green Circle (White Tick)** icon indicates that a file is set to **Always keep on this device**.

- Files set to **Always keep on this device** are available even when you are offline, and they take up additional space on your device.
