Requiring multi-factor authentication for all users safeguards access to your organization's data and applications. Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide a second form of authentication when accessing their account. This second form of authentication is an additional layer of security and minimizes the chances of account compromise.

### Enable multi-factor authentication for a user

Use the following steps to enable multi-factor authentication for a user:

1.	Log in to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://office365.cp.rackspace.com).

2.	From the left menu, select **Office 365 Admin Center**.

3.	From the top menu, select **Multi-factor authentication**. 

4.	Select the check box next to the user you need to enable multi-factor authentication for.

5.	Under quick steps, select **Enable**.

6.	When you are prompted, select **enable multi-factor auth**.

7.	The selected user is now able to configure multi-factor authentication for their account.

#### Require a user to use multi-factor authentication

To require a user to use multi-factor authentication, you must enforce multi-factor authentication for their account.

Use the following steps to enforce multi-factor authentication for a user:

1.	Log in to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://office365.cp.rackspace.com).

2.	From the left menu, select **Office 365 Admin Center**.

3.	From the top menu, select **Multi-factor authentication**.

4.	Select the check box next to the user you need to enforce multi-factor authentication for.

5.	Under quick steps, select **Enforce**.

6.	When you are prompted, select **enforce multi-factor auth**, then **close**.

7.	The selected user is now required to configure and use multi-factor authentication for their account.

### Reset existing multi-factor authentication configuration for a user

Your user may lose access to the device that they used to register with multi-factor authentication. When this occurs, you need to reset their multi-factor settings so that they can re-register.

Use the following steps to reset the existing multi-factor authentication configuration for a user:

1.	Log in to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://office365.cp.rackspace.com).

5.	Under quick steps, select **Manage user settings**.

6.	Select the check box next to **Require selected users to provide contact methods again**.

7.	Select **save** then **close**.

8.	The selected user can now log in to their Office 365 account and re-register with multi-factor authentication.

### Disable multi-factor authentication for a user

1.	Log in to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://office365.cp.rackspace.com).

2.	From the left menu, select **Office 365 Admin Center**.

### Additional information

Microsoft&reg; also provides a guide for deploying multi-factor authentication for your Office 365 tenant. See [Planning a cloud-based Azure Multi-Factor Authentication deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted).

Administrators can configure organization-wide multi-factor authentication requirements by creating a Conditional Access policy in their Azure&reg; Active Directory&reg; from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). See [Conditional Access: Require MFA for all users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa) for instructions.
