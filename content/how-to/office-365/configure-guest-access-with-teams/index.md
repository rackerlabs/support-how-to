Guest Access is disabled by default in Office 365&reg;. A global administrator must turn on Guest Access for teams before team owners can add guests. Users might see the message “Contact your administrator” when trying to add a guest to their team. This shows that the settings either aren't turned on or the settings are not yet in effect.

With Guest Access, organizations can offer access to teams to their partners while maintaining control over their data. All guests in teams are covered under the same compliance rules as the rest of Office 365 and can be securely managed with Azure Active Directory&reg;.

For more information about Office 365 subscriptions, see [Set Up Office 365](/support/how-to/set-up-office-365).
