When you evaluate the security requirements of an application, the
sensitivity of the information stored, processed, or
transmitted by the application is paramount. You have to handle Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) with extra security. PII is personal data
that could compromise individuals' privacy or put them at risk of identity
theft. You should take extra care with servers that contain PII.

### What is PII?

PII includes the following information:

- A combination of any information that identifies an individual
  with that individual's sensitive and non-public financial, health, or
  other data or attribute. This can include a combination of the following
  elements from an individual:
  
   - A name, address, or phone number
   - A social security number or other government-issued number
   - A financial account number
   - A date of birth, address, biometric data, or mother's maiden name
   - Other personally identifiable information.

- Any *non-public personal information* as defined in the
  [Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 USC Subchapter 1, &sect;6809(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6809).

- *Protected health information* as defined in the 
  [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 45 CFR &sect;160.103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/160.103).
