When you evaluate the security requirements of an application, the
sensitivity of information that is being stored, processed, or
transmitted by the application is important. Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) must be handled with extra security. PII is data that
is considered personal in nature and could be used to compromise the
privacy of an individual or for identity theft. Extra care should
be taken with servers that contain PII. To address this specific need,
some Rackspace content discusses PII.

### What is PII?

PII includes the following information:

**(i)** a combination of any information that identifies an individual
with that individual's sensitive and non-public financial, health or
other data or attribute, such as a combination of the individual's name,
address, or phone number with the individual's social security number or
other government issued number, financial account number, date of birth,
address, biometric data, mother's maiden name, or other
personally identifiable information;

**(ii)** any "non-public personal information" as that term is defined
in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act found at 15 USC Subchapter 1, &sect;6809(4),

and **(iii)** "protected health information" as defined in the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act found at 45 CFR &sect;160.103.
