The **Pricing** tab will have the pricing table used to calculate your support fees. *(Except for Elastic Engineering, when calculating the total Rackspace Management Fee for the month, the % of Azure spend at each tier is multiplied by the portion of the Azure spend for the month that falls into that tier. Then, the total is summed. Management fees aren't charged until infrastructure usage for all accounts exceeds $30)*

The **CloudHealth** tab links you to CloudHealth, which will help you to see and breakdown costs, realize savings opportunities, set up budgets, create policies in response to actions, and much more. For any questions and guidance, please contact your Rackspace Customer Success Manager.
