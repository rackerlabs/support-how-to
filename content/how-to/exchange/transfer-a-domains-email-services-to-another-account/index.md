You can transfer a domain's email services from one account to another
without starting a ticket or coordinating with Rackspace Support and
Account Management. Use the following steps to accomplish this task
through your control panel.

**Note:** This transfer is purely administrative; performing the
transfer does not affect existing mail data or mail delivery.

### Initiate a domain transfer

1. Log in to the [Rackspace Email Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

2. Scroll down to the **Domains** section and click **Domains**.

3. In the domain list, locate the domain that you want to move to
   another account.

4. Within the **Transfer** column on the right, click **Start**. The
   **Start Transfer** page is displayed.

   **Note:** The **Transfer** column can be hidden or displayed for
   limited administrators. You set its visibility via the
   **Permissions** tab on the **Add/Edit Admins** page.

5. Review the steps to transfer the domain and then click **Start
   Transfer**.

   The **Start Transfer** page is updated to show a URL (available for
   24 hours) that you can email to the administrator of the destination
   account.

   **Note:** You can click the **Cancel Transfer** button at any time
   to cancel the transfer.

### Accept a domain transfer

The administrator of the destination account performs the following step
to finalize the domain transfer:

1. Using the provided domain transfer URL, log in to the [Email Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/), and click **Finish Transfer**.
