You can transfer a domain's email services from one account to another
without starting a ticket or coordinating with Rackspace Support and
Account Management. Use the following steps to accomplish this task
through your Control Panel:

**Note:** This transfer is purely administrative. Performing the
transfer does not affect existing mail data or mail delivery.

### Initiate a domain transfer

1. Log in to the [Rackspace Email Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

2. Scroll down to the **Domains** section and click **Domains**.

3. In the domain list, locate the domain that you want to move to
   another account.

4. Within the **Transfer** column on the right, click **Start**. The
   **Start Transfer** page displays.

   **Note:** The **Transfer** column can be hidden or displayed for
   limited administrators. You set its visibility through the
   **Permissions** tab on the **Add/Edit Admins** page.

5. Review the steps to transfer the domain and then click **Start Transfer**.

   The **Start Transfer** page updates to show a URL (available for
   24 hours) that you can email to the administrator of the destination
   account.

   **Note:** You can click the **Cancel Transfer** button at any time
   to cancel the transfer.

### Accept a domain transfer

To finalize the domain transfer, the administrator of the destination account performs the following steps:

1. Use the provided domain transfer URL to log into the [Email Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2. Click **Finish Transfer**.
