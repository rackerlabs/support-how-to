   - Email address - enter your entire email address
     (for example, myname@example.com).
   - Method - select **User Name and Password**.

4. Click **Add Account** and confirm that the amber-colored dot next to the
   account name turns from an amber color to a solid green color (this may take
   a moment).

   Close all windows and you're done!

**Note:** The amber dot may take a minute or two to change from amber to green.
If it doesn't change, check the accounts settings and password and make sure you
are using the correct EWS server address.

**Note:** If you already have email on the server, your email will slowly begin
to populate your inbox. This can take some time depending on how much data you
have.
