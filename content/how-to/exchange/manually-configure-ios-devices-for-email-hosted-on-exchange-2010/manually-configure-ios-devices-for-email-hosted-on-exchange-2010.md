Use the procedure in this article to configure a Microsoft&reg; Exchange&reg; 2010 account on your Apple&reg; iOS device.

**Note:** If you do not know which Exchange version you are using, log in to [emailhelp.rackspace.com](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com) with the email address and password you are attempting to set up to see the exact server name settings.


1. On the home screen of your iOS device, tap **Settings**.

2. Tap **Passwords & Accounts**.

3. Tap **Add Account**.

4. Tap **Exchange**.

5. Enter your email address and password, and add a description of the account you are setting up. Then, tap **Next**.

    **Note:** The device verifies the account. If you receive the message `Unable to verify account information`, disregard the message and tap **OK**.

6.	On the server settings page, enter the following information if it is not already present:
    - **Email** - Enter your email address.

    - **Server** - Enter connect.emailsrvr.com.

    - **Domain** - Leave this field blank.

    - **Username** - Verify that your user name is exactly the same as your full email address.

    - **Password** - Enter your email account password.

    - **Description** - Enter a description of the account that you are setting up. Make this description anything that
      helps you identify your account.

7. Tap **Save**.

8.	Tap **Next**.

    Your device creates a secure sockets layer (SSL) connection to the Exchange server. After the device connects, check marks appear confirming that your settings have been verified.

9.	Select the services that you want to sync with the Exchange Server by swiping the **ON/OFF** buttons next to each service. Tap **Save** when you are done.


You have successfully added your Exchange email account on your iOS device.

**Note:** Depending on how much data is in the mailbox, it might take some time before your information is completely downloaded to your device.
