### Block Senders

**Warning:** Outlook Web App does not include a setting to reject senders. It only automatically marks blocked senders as junk. Administrators can reference [Blocklists in Microsoft Exchange](/support/how-to/spam-preferences-safelists-and-black-list-in-microsoft-exchange/#manage-black-list) for instructions on how to reject senders.

1. Log in to your Exchange mailbox at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com)

2. Click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner, and then select **Options** from the drop down menu.
