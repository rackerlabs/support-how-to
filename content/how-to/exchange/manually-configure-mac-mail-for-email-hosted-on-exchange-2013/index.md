This article describes how to set up your Microsoft&reg; Exchange&reg; 2013
email account with Mac&reg; Mail.

**Note:** Exchange 2013 is supported only on OS X El Capitan version 10.11 or later Macintosh&reg; operating system versions. To verify which operating system your Mac is running, select the **Apple**&reg; icon located in the top left-hand corner and then select **About This Mac**.

1. Open Mac Mail, select **Mail**, and then select **Add Account**.

2. You are prompted to select a mail account provider. Select **Exchange**, and then click **Continue**.

3. On the next screen, enter your full name, email address, and click **Sign In**.

4. When you are presented with the options to **Configure Manually** or **Sign In**, click **Configure Manually**.

    **Note:** We recommend that you configure your account automatically by using [Autodiscover](/support/how-to/dns-record-definitions/#cname-record). If you set up your account by using Autodiscover, click **Sign In** instead of **Configure Manually**.

5. On the next screen, enter your full name, email address, and password, and then click **Sign In**.

6. Select the services that you want to sync, such as mail, contacts, and calendar, and then click **Done**.

After completing the steps in this article, Mail begins syncing to your Mac Mail client.

**Note:** If you are prompted for server name settings, log in to [emailhelp.rackspace.com](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com) with the email address and password you are attempting to set up to see the exact server name settings.
