This article explains how to use your Active Directory to synchronize email objects by using Rackspace Directory Sync and Rackspace Hosted Email. It also provides instructions for creating new email addresses, distribution lists, and contacts for Microsoft&reg; Exchange.

### Add a new mailbox

If the email address does not exist in the control panel, a new mailbox
is created during the next synchronization.

**Note:** User objects must be direct members of the specified email
security group. Nested groups cause Directory Sync to create a
distribution group instead of creating mailboxes for users in the nested
group.

1. Set the Active Directory user's email address property
   **mail attribute** to the email address you want.

2. Add the new user to the email security group.

Directory Sync creates a mailbox for the user and synchronizes the user's
password. If this is a first-time setup, the password must be changed to
ensure that the password is synchronized.

### Create a mailbox for an existing user

If the email address exists in the Control Panel, the Active Directory
user synchronizes to the existing mailbox.

**Note:** User objects must be direct members of the specified email
security group. Nested groups cause Directory Sync to create a
distribution group instead of creating mailboxes for users in the nested
group.

1. Verify that the Active Directory user's email address property
    **mail attribute** matches the existing email address.

2. Add the User object to the email security group.

Directory Sync creates a mailbox for the user and synchronizes the
user's password. If this is a first-time setup, the password must be
changed to ensure that the password is synchronized.

### Remove a user mailbox

Use the following steps to remove a user mailbox:

1. Remove the user from the email security group.

    **Note**: Directory Sync disables the user's mailbox.

2. Navigate to the Cloud Office Control Panel.

3. Confirm that the mailbox is disabled.

4. Delete the mailbox.

**Note:** To prevent accidental deletions, Directory Sync
does not automatically delete mailboxes.

### Create a distribution list

Use the following steps to create a distribution list:

1. Create a group within the Active Directory (or use an already
    existing group). This Active Directory group can be either a
    security group or a distribution list.

2. Set the group email **mail attribute**.

    - For new distribution lists, provide an email address before
        subscribing to the Hosted Exchange security group.

    - For existing distribution lists, add an email address if it
        doesn't exist, or update the email address to match the email in
        the Cloud Office Control Panel before synchronizing. If the
        email address doesn't match what is in the Cloud Office Control
        Panel, a new distribution list is created.

3. Subscribe to the new group created in step 1 to the Hosted Exchange
    group specified in the Directory Sync settings. You must set the
    email address in step 2 before you subscribe the distribution group
    to the Hosted Exchange security group.

**Note:** To synchronize members of the distribution list created in step 1 to members of the distribution list in the Control Panel,
the members must also be subscribed to either the Hosted Exchange group
or the Rackspace Email group specified in the Directory Sync settings.

### Delete a distribution list

To delete a distribution list, remove the Distribution List group from
the Hosted Exchange security group specified in the Directory Sync
settings.

**Note:** After the next synchronization, the distribution list is
deleted from the Cloud Office Control Panel.

### Create a contact (Exchange)

Use the following steps to create a contact:

1. Create a Contact object within the Active Directory.

    **Note:** When you are creating the contact, the Display Name within
    the object creates the Display Name within the Cloud Office
    Control Panel for the contact.

2. After the Contact object is created, set the email address. The
    email address points to the external email address of the contact.

3. Subscribe the new contact to the Hosted Exchange group specified in
    the Directory Sync settings.

**Note:** The **objectGUID** attribute of the contact is used as the
username for the contact within the Cloud Office Control Panel. Active
Directory automatically creates this attribute and it is how Directory Sync
references the contact through our API.

Customers with multiple email domains must edit the `otherMailBox`
attribute (of the Contact object) to specify the domain to synchronize.
You only need to have the domain set within this attribute.

### Delete a contact (Exchange)

To delete a contact from Exchange, remove the contact from the Hosted
Exchange security group specified in the Directory Sync settings.

**Note:** After the next synchronization, the contact is deleted
from the Cloud Office Control Panel.

### Change the external email address of a contact (Exchange)

Use the following steps to change an external mail address for a contact:

1. Remove the contact from the Hosted Exchange security group set in
   the Directory Sync settings.

2. Allow the Directory Sync tool to synchronize the new changes. Either
    a manual or an automatic operation can synchronize the new changes.

3. Change the email address of the contact.

4. Add the contact address to the Hosted Exchange security group
    and synchronize.

### Rename a Hosted Service security group

Use the following steps to rename a Hosted Service security group:

1. On the Directory Sync Settings page, select **Do Not Sync** from the email service list and then click **Save & Start Sync**.

2. In Active Directory, rename the security group and the pre-Windows&reg;
    2000 group name. The group name and pre-Windows 2000 group name must
    be identical.

3. Back on the Settings page, select the new group name from the list,
    and then click **Save & Start Sync**.

### Add an alternate email address (optional synchronization)

Use the following steps to add an alternate email address:

1. Enable synchronization. This value is turned off by default.

      1. In the **\\Directory Sync Service\\web** directory, open the
        **appSettings.config** file.
      2. Find the following configuration value:

            `<add key="SyncProxyAddresses" value="False" />`

      3. Change the **value** attribute to **True** to enable synchronization
            of the proxy addresses. This setting will be persistent.

2. Open Active Directory Users and Computers.

3. Open the Attribute Editor of the User Object. The **Advanced
    Features** tab must be enabled in the **View** settings to display
    this tab.

4. Go to the **proxyAddresses** attribute and click **Edit**.

5. Add the alternate email address.

**Note:** The alternate email addresses are formatted as
**SMTP:userA@example.com**. For all alternate email addresses beginning
with `SMTP:`, the full email address must be listed. Domain Aliases
cannot be placed in this attribute. because domain aliases
are automatically created from the primary domain, only the Primary Domain and
Accepted Domains can be listed in this attribute.
