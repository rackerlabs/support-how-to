Rackspace offers a Hosted Exchange&reg; solution for users who require a
collaborative solution for their business or organization.

Hosted Exchange offers distribution lists and the Outlook Web App&reg; (OWA).

### Exchange distribution lists

You can use distribution lists to manage users in a team or group.
Only email addresses in your domain can be part of a distribution list.

For example, you can create a distribution list to group together everyone on
the billing team: bob@example.com, amy@example.com, and
scott@example.com. Adding all members of the billing team to one distribution
list makes it possible to communicate new upcoming billing updates
within the team by writing to one address, such as billingupdates@example.com.

See [Manage distribution lists in Exchange](/support/how-to/manage-distribution-lists-in-exchange/)
for instructions on setting up distribution lists.

### Outlook Web App (OWA)

The Outlook Web App is a direct connection to your email without the
need for additional software. Your web browser is enough.
Messages that are sent and received using OWA are
waiting for you the next time you log in to the portal. The OWA portal
provides most of the functionality that a mail client offers, including
sending and receiving email, setting up email signatures, and setting
rules to filter messages to sub-folders.

#### Advantages of OWA versus email clients

- There is no need to configure additional server settings for OWA.
- Email is ready to access 24/7 through your preferred web browser.
- Messages are stored in the cloud, so no local storage is consumed.
- Changes made to Contacts, Calendar, and Mail items are synced down to
  all other devices configured with your account.

#### Accessing OWA

To access the Outlook Web App, log in [here](https://apps.rackspace.com).
