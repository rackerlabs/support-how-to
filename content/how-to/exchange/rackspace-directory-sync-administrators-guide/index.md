This article provides information for administrators using Rackspace Directory
Sync. It includes information about how Directory Sync works with Active
Directory&reg; and how to use local domains to synchronize to Rackspace Hosted
Email.

Using Directory Sync for your organization provides these benefits:

- **Same sign-on**: Users have one password for their local network access and
    their email accounts for the same sign-on experience.
- **Ease of management**: Administrators can manage mail-enabled objects
    directly from a familiar Microsoft&reg; Active Directory interface. Choose
    which user objects to synchronize. Synchronize a single user in your Active
    Directory, or synchronize all of them at the same time.
- **Save time**: Directory Sync can save considerable effort and time when
    onboarding new employees and managing password policies in large numbers.
- **Business automation**: Rackspace Directory Sync uses the
    Rackspace Email public REST APIs to facilitate automation.
- **Secure**: All data exchanged is encrypted by using Secure Sockets Layer
    (SSL), and synchronization is only one-way.
- **Cost-effective**: Rackspace Directory Sync is available at no additional
    cost.

#### Supported objects and platforms

Rackspace Directory Sync supports the synchronization of the following Active
Directory objects:

- Active Directory user mailboxes
- Active Directory user passwords for the same sign-on
- Active Directory contacts (Hosted Exchange)
- Distribution groups (Hosted Exchange)

Directory Sync supports the following Rackspace Email platforms:

- Hosted Exchange 2010
- Hosted Exchange 2013
- Hosted Exchange 2016
- Hosted Exchange Hybrid
- Rackspace Email

Directory Sync supports the following Active Directory platforms:

- Windows&reg; 2012 and 2012 R2
- Windows Server&reg; 2008 and 2008 R2

#### Directory Sync limitations

- Directory Sync does not synchronize with Hosted Exchange 2007.
- Existing mail data does not migrate with Directory Sync to our hosted
    environment. We offer several methods that you can use to migrate your own
    data, as described in the article [Email migration
    services](/support/how-to/email-migration-services).
- Synchronizes user passwords at the moment you change a password. You cannot
    synchronize passwords retroactively because they are unreadable from Active
    Directory. Users must change their passwords for Directory Sync to
    synchronize the change with their mailbox.
- Directory Sync is not LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) compatible.
- Windows Server 2003 and the Active Directory functional level of 2003 are not
    supported.

#### Installation and configuration

See [Rackspace Directory Sync: Install and
configure](/support/how-to/rackspace-directory-sync-install-and-configure) to
get started.

**Note:** You *must* restart the domain controller during installation
for the password synchronization to work.

#### How Directory Sync works

Directory Sync automatically synchronizes changes from your local directory to
your email accounts every five minutes. You can also click **Sync Now** to
synchronize immediately.

Directory Sync synchronizes only one-way. It does not synchronize information
from Hosted Exchange or Rackspace Email back to your Active Directory. If you
change any information, such as passwords, by using Outlook&reg; Web App or
Control Panel, it does not synchronize you mailboxes with Active Directory.

#### Domain names

Directory Sync synchronizes one local Active Directory domain with multiple
email domains.

The domain names can be the same or different. You specify the local Active
Directory domain at set up.

#### Security groups

Directory Sync uses Active Directory security groups to manage which objects it
synchronizes with your email service. If you use Hosted Exchange, create a new
security group for the users that synchronize with Exchange mailboxes. If you
use Rackspace Email, create a new security group for the users that synchronize
with Rackspace Email mailboxes. If you use both Hosted Exchange and Rackspace
Email, you create two security groups. Directory Sync creates and manages
mailboxes for all user objects that you add to the security groups.

#### User mailboxes

Directory Sync associates Active Directory user objects with email accounts by
using their mail attribute. The mail attribute is the email address property
associated with the user.

#### Password synchronization

Password synchronization occurs after the user object has synchronized with the
mailbox. Password change synchronization occurs on an interval with a
higher priority than other synchronization sessions.

When you install Directory Sync, it cannot automatically synchronize existing
passwords because they are unreadable from Active Directory. Users continue to
use their old email passwords. When users manually change their password,
Directory Sync synchronizes it with their mailbox. Be sure to assign user
objects to email security groups before you change passwords. Otherwise,
Directory Sync does not set the new passwords.

When you create new mailboxes, those users must change their passwords before
they can access their email.

If you manage your Active Directory with multiple domain controllers, you must
install the Directory Sync Password Handler on all secondary domain controllers.
This handler synchronizes password changes on secondary domain
controllers to the primary domain controller and then synchronizes those changes
to Rackspace Hosted Mail.

#### Distribution list membership synchronization

Synchronize users within distribution lists or security groups from Active
Directory to distribution list membership within the Control Panel. Directory
Sync uses the group's email address property to synchronize with the Hosted
Exchange distribution list.

#### Exchange contacts

Synchronize contact objects within Active Directory to your Exchange contacts
within the Hosted Exchange environment. Within Active Directory, you can set up
the external email address to which the contact forwards. Directory Sync uses
the contact object's mail attribute to set this.

#### Alternate email addresses (optional synchronization)

You can use the `proxyAddresses` attribute to create alternate email addresses
(aliases) for the Hosted Exchange environment. If you set the `proxyAddresses`
attribute to include `SMTP: userA@example.net`, then Directory Sync adds the
address `userA@example.net` to the environment as an alias to that email
address.

- Any address that begins with `smtp:` in the `proxyAddresses` attribute creates
    an alternate email address associated with the user's mailbox.
- These addresses cannot include a domain alias in the address but can include
    either the primary domain or accepted domains.
- You can create alternate email addresses associated with domain aliases by
    using the primary domain. For example, `smtp:userB@example.com` creates the
    alternate address `userB@example.net`.
- Create accepted domains with the full email address (including the
    domain). For example, `smtp:userA@example.org` creates the alternate address
    `userA@example.org`.

#### How to enable synchronization of proxy addresses:

1. Find the setting in the **appSettings.config** file in the **\Directory
    Sync Service\web** directory.
2. Go to the following configuration value:

        `<add key="SyncProxyAddresses" value="False" />`

3. Change the setting to `True` to enable syncing of the proxy addresses. Future
    upgrade installations do not revert this setting.

#### Additional notes

- The **Attribute Editor** is visible in the **Active Directory Users and
    Computer** (ADUC) console with the **Advanced Features** enabled in the
    **View** tab.
- You must configure domain aliases and accepted domains with the help of Cloud
    Office Support before configuring alternate addresses to ensure that they
    are synchronized correctly.
- During the initial set up, ensure the `proxyAddresses` attribute does not
    contain any domain aliases to avoid errors.
- Alternate addresses are available to Exchange mailboxes only. They do not work
    with distribution lists or contacts.

### Security

This section describes some security considerations.

#### User password requirements

Directory Sync does not set an email password that does not meet minimal
password requirements. We recommend that you change your domain password rules
to meet or exceed these requirements.

#### Rackspace Email and Hosted Exchange password requirements

Note the following email requirements:

- At least eight characters long
- At least 3 of the following:
  - At least one lowercase character
  - At least one uppercase character
  - At least one number
  - At least one non-alphanumeric (!, \$, \#, %, space, and so on)

#### Network ports

You do not have to open any inbound ports from the Internet to your domain
controllers.

Enable the following ports on the Directory Sync server:

- **443**: Outbound HTTPS connections from Directory Sync service to [Rackspace API](https://api.emailsrvr.com)
- **8732**: Open for connections from other domain controllers to the Directory
    Sync server. Don't use for any connections outside your network. The domain
    controller password hooks use this port.
- **8080**: This port is only used locally on the Directory Sync service
    machine for the web browser. You may block this port for any external
    connections.

#### Network encryption

HTTPS secures communications between Directory Sync and Rackspace. Microsoft®
WCF Transport Security, which uses Windows Authentication and encryption,
secures communications between the Active Directory password hook and Directory
Sync.

### Synchronized user attributes

Directory Sync synchronizes the following user attributes with Hosted Exchange
and Rackspace Email mailboxes. Some attributes differ between Rackspace Email
and Exchange mailboxes.

Each list element contains the email attribute, the Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI)
property, and any limitations in parnetheses.
