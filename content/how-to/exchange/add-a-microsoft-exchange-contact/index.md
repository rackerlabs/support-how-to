The following article explains how to create a contact with
Microsoft&reg; Exchange&reg;. You can use a contact to create an alias that
forwards to a mailbox hosted outside your domain, such as Gmail or Yahoo.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).

2. In **Microsoft Exchange**, select **Contacts** > **Add Contact**.

   **Note:** If you have multiple domains, you might need to select a domain name.

3. Enter the following **User Details**:

   - First name
   - Last name
   - Display name: The name displayed in the Global Address Book.
   - User name
   - External email: The email address to which the email should route.

   If you do not want this contact to be visible in the Global Address Book, check the **Hide from Global Address List** box.

4. Click **Save**.
