We provide our customers with a private label version of *MigrationWiz*.
This means that many features that are present in the full version of
MigrationWiz are not readily available. If you choose to, you can use the full
version instead. If you are not looking for the features provided by the
full version of MigrationWiz, see
[Migrate your email by using the Self-Service Migration tool](/support/how-to/migrate-your-email-by-using-the-self-service-migration-tool)
for the standard steps.

### Benefits of the full version of MigrationWiz

MigrationWiz:

- Is designed for power users
- Runs more migration projects at once
- Shows detailed statistics about the migration
- Stops migrations
- Shows the speed and progress of a migration
- Performs date range migrations
- Has customizable migrations
- Can schedule migrations to auto-start

### Support and cost considerations

Before deciding whether to use the full version rather than the private label
version, consider how that choice affects migration costs and support procedures.

#### Cost differences

When migrating to Rackspace Email and Apps, users receive the discounted rate
of $0 per mailbox only when migrating via the Private Label Portal at
<https://rackspace.selfmigration.com>.

If you purchase licenses through <https://migrationwiz.com>, those licenses
are listed at the retail price of $11.99 per mailbox.  In order to take
advantage of the discounted rate in the full version of MigrationWiz,
migrations must be initiated in the Private Label Portal, then used in the full
version.

#### Support differences

Support for the full version of MigrationWiz is available through MigrationWiz
support directly through their [Contact Form](https://www.migrationwiz.com/Public/ContactUs.aspx).

Support for the private label version of MigrationWiz is available through the
Rackspace Email and Apps Support team.
