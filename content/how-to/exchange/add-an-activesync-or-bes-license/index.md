To set up your Microsoft Exchange email account on your mobile device,
add an ActiveSync or BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES)
license through the Cloud Office Control Panel. Perform the steps in
this article to add an ActiveSync or BES license.

1. Log in to the Cloud Office Control Panel and select **Go to section** ->
   **Microsoft Exchange**.

   **Note**: The Cloud Office Control Panel that you access depends on the
   region in which the service was started.

   - US Cloud Office customers, use <https://cp.rackspace.com/>.

   - International and MyRackspace Cloud Office customers, log in to
     <https://login.rackspace.com/>. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Dedicated Hosting**, and then click **Products > Cloud Office > Open Mail Control Panel**.

   - Or, all customers can
     access <https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp> directly.

2. In the Exchange **Email Accounts** section, select **Other Services** -> **Mobile
   Messaging**.

3. Select **View Users** for either **Blackberry** or **Activesync
   (iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile)**, depending on your device, and
   then click **Add**.

4. Select the user to whom you are assigning the license.

   This works differently for different kinds of licenses:

   - If you're adding a BES license, select the user to whom you are
     assigning the license from the **Select User** window, provide a
     4-digit activation pin under **Activation Password**, and click
     **Save**.

   - If you're adding an Activesync license, select the user to whom
     you are assigning the license from the **Eligible Users in this Domain**
     window, click **Add** in the middle, and then click **Save**.

     **Note**: After you've assigned your licenses, allow 10 minutes for
     them to fully propagate.
