Hosted Microsoft&reg; Skype for Business is a unified communications tool that offers
secure instant messaging, video chat, file transfer, and presence to
users from desktop and mobile devices. It is available as an add-on
for the Rackspace Hosted Exchange 2013 and 2016 email platforms.

The rollout of the Rackspace Hosted Skype for Business service to
your users varies based on the size of your organization and your
IT infrastructure. The overall deployment plan has three basic steps. This
article is designed to help you decide the best rollout method for your
environment.

### Set up DNS records for Skype for Business

As the first step, you must create auto-discover entries on your DNS
server. If you have an internal DNS, you must also set up these records
on your internal DNS.

We highly recommend that you perform this step because all of the Hosted
Skype for Business features work only if DNS is correctly configured. For
instructions, see [Set up Cloud Office Skype for Business DNS records](/support/how-to/set-up-dns-records-for-cloud-office-skype-for-business/).

**Note:** If you are a Rackspace Hosted Exchange customer, these
settings are in addition to what you might currently have for Hosted
Exchange Autodiscover.

### Activate Skype for Business for users in the Email Administrator Control Panel

You can enable Skype for Business for your entire domain or only for selected users.
In the Email Administrator Control Panel, click on the Skype for Business hyperlink to
go to the Skype for Business page. Then select the check box next to the users to
enable Skype for Business for them.

### Deploy and distribute the client

Depending on the complexity of your environment, you have various
options for deploying Skype for Business clients for desktops. The Skype for Business 2013 client is
part of the Microsoft Office Professional Plus bundle. You can also
download a basic version for free.
