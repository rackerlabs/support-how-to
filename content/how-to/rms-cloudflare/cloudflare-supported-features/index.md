At Rackspace, we want to make your security experience as seamless as
possible. To do this, we have evaluated the extensive list of Cloudflare&reg;
features. We identified areas where we can perform feature
configuration for you or consult with you on industry best practices, what
we've seen make others successful, and landmines to avoid.

The following table describes which features we support and will be
updated as we include new features and functionality:

**Add-on features. Configuration and consultation**
