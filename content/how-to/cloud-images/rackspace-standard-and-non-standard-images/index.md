The [Rackspace Cloud Terms of
Service](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos)
refer to standard and non-standard images. This article provides more
information about those terms.

### Standard images

Standard images are all of the base images that are supplied by Rackspace for
your service level and RackConnect status that have not yet reached
end-of-life status.

### Non-standard images

Any images that are not standard for your account's service level and
RackConnect status are non-standard. The following images are considered
non-standard images. Note that this list is not exhaustive.

-    All imported and exported images
-    All end-of-life images
-    Any shared images that you receive
-    The boot.rackspace.com image and any customer-created images that are
     derived from it

### Support for non-standard images

Non-standard images are subject to Rackspace Managed Infrastructure policies.
For more information about Rackspace service levels, see the [explanation of
Rackspace service levels](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/service-levels/).

### Pricing

Although there is no separate fee for using Cloud Images, you incur indirect
costs for the underlying services that you use.

### How can I determine whether an image is standard or non-standard?

For information to help you determine whether an image is standard or
non-standard, see [Identifying Rackspace standard
images](/support/how-to/identifying-rackspace-standard-images).
