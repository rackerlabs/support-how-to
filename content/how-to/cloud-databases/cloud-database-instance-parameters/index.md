This article describes Cloud Databases instance parameters and provides information about the accessibility of your databases.

### Quick facts

Here are some important facts to consider when you create a new instance:

-   The length of the instance name is limited to 255 characters, and you can
    use any characters that you want.
-   You can create a database instance with one or more databases.
    You can configure databases and users when you create the instance,
    or at a later time.
-   The default binding for the MySQL instance is port 3306.

### Accessibility

For enhanced security, database instances are directly accessible on the
internal Rackspace network and by using a cloud resource within the same
regional data center. For example, a database instance in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) can only be accessed by a cloud server in DFW. For more information, see [Public and private access for Cloud
Databases](/support/how-to/public-and-private-access-for-cloud-databases)
and [Connect to a Cloud Databases
instance](/support/how-to/connect-to-a-cloud-databases-instance).
