Many businesses use both relational databases and non-relational databases.
While NoSQL databases are gaining popularity due to their speed and
scalability, highly structured SQL databases might be preferable in certain
cases.

### Prerequisite

For an introduction to relational databases and NoSQL databases, see [Types of
databases](/support/how-to/types-of-databases/)

### Understand when a SQL database might be preferable

You might choose an SQL database for the following reasons:

- You want to ensure ACID compliance. ACID stands for atomicity, consistency,
  isolation, and durability. ACID compliance reduces anomalies and protects
  the integrity of your database by prescribing exactly how transactions
  interact with the database.

- Your data is structured and unchanging. If your business isn’t experiencing
  significant growth that would require additional servers and you’re only
  working with data that is consistent, then an SQL database might be adequate.
