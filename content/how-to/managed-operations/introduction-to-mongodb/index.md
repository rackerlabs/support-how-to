MongoDB&reg; is an open source NoSQL database. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like
documents that can vary in structure. Because MongoDB uses dynamic schemas,
users can create records without defining the data structure first.

MongoDB stores related information together, which enables queries to process
more quickly. To retrieve information, users leverage the MongoDB query
language.

### Prerequisites

For an introduction to NoSQL databases, see the following articles:

- [Types of databases](/support/how-to/types-of-databases)
- [Examples of RDBMS and NoSQL databases](/support/how-to/examples-of-rdbms-and-nosql-databases)

### Terminology and concepts

Many concepts in MongoDB have close analogies to concepts in relational
databases such as Oracle Database&reg;. The following table compares the basic
concepts.

| MongoDB                        | Oracle Database |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Collection                     | Table           |
| Document                       | Row             |
| Field                          | Column          |
| Embedded documents and linking | Joins           |

### Feature comparison

The following table compares the features of MongoDB with the features of
Oracle Database:

| Feature              | MongoDB | Oracle Database |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Rich data model      | Yes     | No              |
| Dynamic schema       | Yes     | No              |
| Typed data           | Yes     | Yes             |
| Data locality        | Yes     | No              |
| Field updates        | Yes     | Yes             |
| Easy for programmers | Yes     | No              |

### Query language

Both MongoDB and Oracle Database have their own rich query language. However,
there are some differences between them. In order to handle advanced queries,
Oracle Database supports procedures and functions for manipulating the data
that is returned from the SELECT statement. In contrast, MongoDB uses callback
functions for advanced queries. The mongo shell uses the JavaScript
programming language to run these functions.

### Are MongoDB and Oracle Database used together?

Yes. There are many examples of hybrid deployments of MongoDB and Oracle
Database, particularly among e-commerce applications. The flexible data model
that MongoDB uses is a good fit for product catalogs because catalogs typically
include multiple products with different attributes. However, Oracle Database
is generally used for checkout systems because these systems require complex
transactions.

Oracle Database is better suited to handle such transactions because it uses
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) as its integrity model.
This model gives Oracle Database integrity features that MongoDB doesn't
offer, such as isolation, referential integrity, and revision control.

In other cases, new business requirements push organizations to adopt MongoDB
so that they can incorporate next-generation components into their
applications. For example, both MongoDB and Oracle Database use conditional
entry updates, composite keys, Unicode characters, and full-text search.
However, MongoDB also has a built-in map-reduce function for aggregating large
amounts of data.
