If you currently have the Managed Infrastructure support service level for
Rackspace Public Cloud, you can upgrade to the Managed Operations service level.


### Upgrade to the Managed Operations service level

1.  In the **Cloud Control Panel**, choose **Rackspace Cloud** from the drop-down list of products that is located at the top of the page on the utility navigation bar.

2.  Click **Account** on the utility navigation bar to see your current level of service under **Service Level** from the drop-down list.

3.  With the drop-down list under **Account** still open, click **Upgrade Service Level**.

4.  To upgrade your service level to Managed Operations, click **Learn More**
    under Managed Operations.

    **Important:** If you upgrade your service level, you cannot revert back to
    the previous level.

5.  In the pop-up window, click **Request Upgrade**.

6.  On the **Confirm Managed Operations Upgrade** page, read the information
    provided. Open the **Terms of Service** link and read the terms of service.

7.  If you agree to the terms, select both check boxes, and then click **Request Upgrade**.

    A confirmation of your upgrade displays on the screen.

**Note:** You will see the changes in effect the next time you log in.
