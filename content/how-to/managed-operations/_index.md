Cloud Servers with a Managed Operations Service Level extends the enhanced managed support level from our Managed Services offering into our Cloud offering. The Managed Operations Service Level provides an additional level of support that includes monitoring, OS and application infrastructure layer support, and technical guidance for Cloud Servers.

The Managed Operations Service Level includes access to a dedicated, 24x7x365 support team via phone, chat, and online support ticket. The team will support your servers from the OS up through the application stack of Microsoft SQL Server, .Net/IIS, and the LAMP stack on Linux. Your Cloud Server will be regularly patched and updated. Monitoring services are included, with the Managed Operations team proactively responding to any alerts. We will monitor up to two user-defined ports as well as user-defined URL content.
