This article presents several common relational database management systems
(RDBMSs) and NoSQL databases.

### Prerequisite

For an introduction to RDBMSs and NoSQL databases, see [Properties of RDBMSs and NoSQL databases](/support/how-to/properties-of-rdbmss-and-nosql-databases/).

### Popular relational databases and RDBMSs

The following list describes popular SQL and RDBMS databases:

- **Oracle&reg;**: An object-relational database management system (DBMS) that is
  written in the C++ language.

- **IBM DB2&reg;**: A family of database server products from IBM&reg;.

- **SAP ASE&reg;**: A relational database server product for businesses that is
  primarily used on the Unix&reg; operating system.

- **Microsoft SQL Server&reg;**: An RDBMS for enterprise-level databases that supports both
  SQL and NoSQL architectures.

- **Maria DB&reg;**: An enhanced, drop-in version of MySQL&reg;.

- **PostgreSQL&reg;**: An enterprise-level, object-relational DBMS that uses
  procedural languages such as Perl and Python in addition to SQL-level code.


### Popular NoSQL databases

The following list describes popular NoSQL databases:

- **MongoDB&reg;**: The most popular open-source NoSQL system. MongoDB is a
  document-oriented database that stores JSON-like documents in dynamic
  schemas.

- **Apache CouchDB&reg;**: An open source, web-oriented database developed by Apache&reg;.
  CouchDB uses the JSON data exchange format to store its documents;
  JavaScript for indexing, combining, and transforming documents; and HTTP for
  its API.

- **Apache HBase&reg;**: An open source Apache project that was developed as a part of
  Hadoop&reg;. HBase is a column store database written in Java. It has
  capabilities similar to those that Google BigTable&reg; provides.

- **Oracle NoSQL Database&reg;**: A propietary database that supports JSON, table and key-value datatypes running on-premise, or as a cloud service.

- **Apache Cassandra DB&reg;**: A distributed database that excels at handling extremely
  large amounts of structured data. Cassandra DB is also highly scalable.
  Cassandra DB was created at Facebook&reg;.

- **Riak&reg;**: An open source, key-value store database written in Erlang. Riak
  has built-in fault-tolerance replication and automatic data distribution
  that enable it to offer excellent performance.

- **Objectivity InfiniteGraph&reg;**: A highly specialized graph database that focuses on
  graph data structures. InfiniteGraph is useful for finding hidden
  relationships in big data. It is implemented in Java.
