This page presents several common relational database management systems
(RDBMSs) and NoSQL databases.

### Prerequisite

For an introduction to RDBMSs and NoSQL databases, see [Properties of RDBMSs and NoSQL databases](/support/how-to/properties-of-rdbmss-and-nosql-databases/).

### Popular relational databases and RDBMSs

The following list describes popular SQL and RDBMS databases:

- **Oracle**: An object-relational database management system (DBMS) that is
  written in the C++ language.
- **IBM DB2**: A family of database server products from IBM.
- **Sybase**: A relational database server product for businesses that is
  primarily used on the Unix operating system.
- **MS SQL Server**: An RDBMS for enterprise-level databases that supports both
  SQL and NoSQL architectures. MS SQL Server was developed by Microsoft.
- **Maria DB**: An enhanced, drop-in version of MySQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: An enterprise-level, object-relational DBMS that uses
  procedural languages such as Perl and Python in addition to SQL-level code.

#### Popular NoSQL databases

The following list describes popular NoSQL databases:

- **MongoDB**: The most popular open-source NoSQL system. MongoDB is a
  document-oriented database that stores JSON-like documents in dynamic
  schemas. Craigslist, eBay, and Foursquare use MongoDB.
- **CouchDB**: An open source, web-oriented database developed by Apache.
  CouchDB uses the JSON data exchange format to store its documents;
  JavaScript for indexing, combining, and transforming documents; and HTTP for
  its API.
- **HBase**: An open source Apache project that was developed as a part of
  Hadoop. HBase is a column store database written in Java. It has
  capabilities similar to those that BigTable provides.
- **Oracle NoSQL Database**: Oracleâ€™s NoSQL database.
- **Cassandra DB**: A distributed database that excels at handling extremely
  large amounts of structured data. Cassandra DB is also highly scalable.
  Cassandra DB was created at Facebook. It is used by Instagram, Comcast,
  Apple, and Spotify.
- **Riak**: An open source, key-value store database written in Erlang. Riak
  has built-in fault-tolerance replication and automatic data distribution
  that enable it to offer excellent performance.
- **InfoGrid**: An open source web graph database for creating RESTful Web
  applications that use graphed data.
- **InfiniteGraph**: A highly specialized graph database that focuses on
  graph data structures. InfiniteGraph is useful for finding hidden
  relationships in big data. It is implemented in Java.
