This page presents an overview of Apache Cassandra, an open source, key-value
NoSQL database.

### Prerequisites

For an introduction to NoSQL databases, see the following articles:

- [Types of databases](/support/how-to/types-of-databases)
- [Examples of RDBMS and NoSQL databases](/support/how-to/examples-of-rdbms-and-nosql-databases)

### Benefits of using Cassandra

Cassandra is high-performing and horizontally scalable. It also offers
operational simplicity.

Cassandra is fully distributed, with no single point of failure. Full
distribution enables Cassandra to provide continuous availability. Cassandra
uses a peer-to-peer distribution model that makes it easy to distribute data
across multiple data centers and cloud availability zones.

Cassandra uses a partitioner, or partitioning key, to determine how data is
distributed across the nodes that make up a database cluster. A partitioner is
a hashing mechanism that takes a table row's primary key, computes a numerical
token for it, and assigns it to one of the nodes in a cluster. While Cassandra
has multiple partitioners from which to choose, the default partitioner
randomizes data across a cluster and ensures an even distribution of all
of the data. In addition, Cassandra automatically maintains the balance of
data across a cluster even when existing nodes are removed or new nodes are
added to a system.

Cassandra is a good choice when you have a very large amount of data and
consistency isn't a priority.

### Terminology and concepts

Many concepts in Cassandra have close analogs to concepts in relational
databases such as Oracle Database. The following table compares the basic
concepts in these systems:

| Cassandra   | Oracle Database |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Keyspace    | Database/schema |
| Table       | Table           |
| Row         | Row             |
| Column      | Column          |
| Primary key | Primary key     |

### Feature comparison

The following table compares the features of Cassandra with the features of Oracle Database:

| Feature              | Cassandra | Oracle Database |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Rich data model      | Yes       | No              |
| Dynamic schema       | Yes       | No              |
| Typed data           | Yes       | Yes             |
| Data locality        | Yes       | No              |
| Field updates        | Yes       | Yes             |
| Easy for programmers | Yes       | No              |

### Query language

Both Cassandra and Oracle Database have their own rich query language.
However, there are some differences between them. In order to handle advanced
queries, Oracle Database supports procedures and functions for manipulating
the data that is returned from the SELECT statement. In contrast, Cassandra
uses the Cassandra Query Language (CQL). This language runs through the
Cassandra shell, which is called cqlsh.

The following table provides a few examples of how CQL statements and SQL
statements differ:

| Cassandra (CQL) | Oracle Database (SQL) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, display_name)<br />VALUES (‘Lebron’,‘James’,‘KingJames’); | INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, display_name)<br />VALUES ('Lebron', 'James', 'KingJames'); |
| SELECT * FROM users; | SELECT * FROM users; |
| UPDATE users SET state = 'TX'<br>Where user_uuid=88b8fd18-b1ed-4e96-bf79-4280797cba80; | UPDATE users SET status = 'C'<br />WHERE age > 25; |

### Are Cassandra and Oracle Database used together?

Yes. There are many examples of hybrid deployments of Cassandra and Oracle
Database. In some cases, new business requirements push organizations to adopt
Cassandra so that they can incorporate next-generation components into their
applications.

For example, both Cassandra and Oracle Database use conditional entry updates,
composite keys, Unicode characters, and full-text search. However, Cassandra
also has auto-replication functions that automatically distribute and maintain
data across a cluster. Replication in Cassandra is very straightforward and
simple to configure and maintain.

While Oracle Database uses the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability) integrity model, Cassandra offers the AID portion of ACID, in
which the data written is atomic, isolated, and durable. The AID model enables
Cassandra users to decide exactly how strong data consistency should be for a
transaction or set of transactions that are batched together. Strength of data
consistency refers to whether all nodes must respond, or if a single node
responds while the others are being updated.

Cassandra users can tune data consistency within a single data center or
across multiple data centers. However, Oracle Database offers integrity
features that Cassandra doesn't offer, such as isolation, transactions,
referential integrity, and revision control.  

Both Cassandra and Oracle Database are horizontally scalable and support data
replication.

### Limitations of Cassandra

While there are several advantages to using Cassandra, there are also
limitations that make Cassandra unsuitable for use as a general-purpose
database. For example, because Cassandra doesn’t have built-in aggregation
functionality, it does not group data by sum, min, or max. Any aggregations
must be pre-computed and stored.

In addition, tables cannot be joined in Cassandra. Data must therefore be
de-normalized before it is stored in the database.  

Finally, search is based on keys and indexes only. Cassandra does not support
additional search clauses, additional conditions, or sorting on non-key fields.
