Get quick answers to common questions about the service levels for Managed
OpenStack Public Cloud.

#### What are the service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

Managed Public OpenStack Cloud has the following service levels:

-   Managed Infrastructure: Rackspace manages the data center,
    infrastructure, and virtualization layers.
-   Managed Operations: Rackspace manages the data center, infrastructure,
    virtualization layers, operating system, database layer, and web server.

#### What is the service-level pricing model?

The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your total
cloud expense by separating the cost of infrastructure and support.

The infrastructure rate is based on the number of gigabytes (GB) of random
access memory (RAM) used during the billing cycle, and not on the types of
server. This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger
servers.

The support cost, or Service Level Rate, is determined by the total Compute
power used. The Service Level Rate covers the maintenance and support of all
your cloud Compute products (such as servers), and is based on your service
level. OnMetal servers have a flat hourly rate independent of RAM. If you do
not meet the minimum Service Level Rate during your billing cycle, the
difference is assessed to your account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but the Service Level Rate
is only assessed against Compute products. Storage services such as Cloud Files
and Cloud Block Storage have no Service Level Rates associated with them.

#### Can new customers choose other service levels for Managed OpenStack Public Cloud?

No, new customers can choose *only* Managed Infrastructure or Managed
Operations. Customers with an older service level, such as the Infrastructure
service level, can stay on that level or move to one of the new levels.
Customers who upgrade to a new service level can't return to the old level.

#### What happens with customers who are on the old Infrastructure service level?

Customers who have the Infrastructure service level are grandfathered into
their current pricing plan and continue to receive the same support as always,
along with any enhancements we announce.

#### Is Rackspace improving the support experience?

Yes, we are always looking at ways to improve our support. We expect that our
pricing changes will cause some new customers who donâ€™t value support to choose
other providers. As a result, we will be able to shift more resources to serve
customers who do value support and are willing to pay for it.

#### What do I get with support from Rackspace?
