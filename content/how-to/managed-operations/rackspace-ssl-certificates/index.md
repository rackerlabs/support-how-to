To purchase a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate from Rackspace, a customer
must have at least one active Linux&reg; or Windows&reg; dedicated server.
Rackspace SSL certificates are not available to customers who use only cloud
servers.

### To purchase a certificate

1. Open the Customer Portal and click on **Network**.
2. Select **SSL Certificate**.
3. Click on **Actions** in the upper-right corner.
4. Select **Purchase Certificate**.
5. Choose the certificate you want from the list.

After you purchase a certificate, a ticket is generated that provides
instructions for certificate installation.

To learn more about the certificate types, click on **Compare SSL
Certificate** in the **Certificate Type** section to see a comparison chart that
shows the following information:

- Pricing by SSL type and duration
- Details for the SSL, which you can see by clicking on the **SSL** column heading
