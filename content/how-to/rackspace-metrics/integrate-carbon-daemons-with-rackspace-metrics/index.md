#### Description

Carbon Forwarder enables you to integrate with the carbon daemons that make up the storage back end of a Graphite installation.

The integration is through a Carbon Forwarder instance that accepts pickle protocols metrics, which is the only protocol used by a graphite carbon relay.

#### Dependencies

Carbon Forwarder has the following dependencies.

- [twistd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted)
- [mock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock)
- [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest)
- [txKeystone](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txKeystone)

#### Install Carbon Forwarder

Use the following command to install Carbon Forwarder.

    git clone https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood-carbon-forwarder.git

    cd blueflood-carbon-forwarder

    python setup.py install

#### Run Carbon Forwarder

Use the following command to run Carbon Forwarder.

    twistd blueflood-forward

| **Switch** | **Description** | **default** |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| -e | Endpoint to listen on for pickle protocol metrics | tcp:2004 |
| -i | Metrics send interval, in seconds | 30.0 |
| -b | Blueflood address | https://localhost:19000 |
| -t | Tenant ID | tenant |
| -p | Prefix to add to metrics name | metric\_prefix |
| --ttl | Time-to-live value for metrics, in seconds | 86400 |
| -u | Keystone user |   |
| -k | Keystone key |   |
| --auth-url | Keystone token URL |   |

If you don't need authentication, leave the -u/--user command line argument empty (which is the default value).

#### Send metrics

To send a test metric to the twistd server that you just started, run the following command.

    python tests/scripts/sendPickle.py

Modify the script accordingly for your local testing.

#### Configure Carbon Forwarder

To complete the configuration, pass the following command-line arguments to the twistd daemon.

    twistd -n -l - blueflood-forward --help

#### Logging (optional)

If not using your own LogObserver, use the following command to control logging by using LogObserver.

    twistd --logger carbonforwarderlogging.forwarder_log_observer.get_log_observer blueflood-forward
