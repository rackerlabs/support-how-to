Grafana&reg; is a popular dashboard tool for IT Ops. We designed Rackspace Metrics to meet
the functional and performance requirements of enterprise-scale metrics. By integrating with
Grafana, Rackspace Metrics changes the cost-structure of metrics collection by replacing the
storage component without changing the users' workflow.

When annotations sent to Rackspace Metrics appear in a Grafana dashboard, customers can get
insight into the events that might have caused the changes in the performance graph.

### Annotations

The concept of *annotations* traces back to a blog post by the Etsy team. The post explains how
they used annotations to make events like releases appear in the performance graph, which provided
valuable information about the changes on the graph.

Through Grafana, Rackspace Metrics users can create a dashboard to help identify the performance
changes in a system. Although detection is the first step toward managing the application, the next
step is to determine what has changed.

With annotation support, users can submit information about change events that appears with the
graph. These annotations add information for the graph on the dashboard.

#### Submit annotations through the API

You submit annotations for events through the `/events` API endpoint, as shown in the following example:

    curl https://global.metrics-ingest.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/737305/events -X POST -d '{
          "what": "app03 deployment",
          "when": 1452105873000,
          "tags": "deployment",
          "data": "deploying prod"
        }
    ' -H 'X-Auth-Token: e0247392bdd04ef0afa4f0b868fe99a4' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json'

**Note**: The value for the `when` field is the epoch time in milliseconds. To convert the date
strings to and from epoch time, you can use the dating method in Mac OS X&reg; or use
[https://www.epochconverter.com/](https://www.epochconverter.com/).

    > date +%s
    1452101351

    > date -j +%s -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "Mon Jan  4 12:43:57 PST 2016"
    1451940237

    > date -j -f "%m/%d/%Y %T %Z" "01/04/2016 12:43:57 PST" +%s
    1451940237

    > date -r 1451940237
    Mon Jan 4 12:43:57 PST 2016

For more information about this operation, see
[Send an annotation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/ingestion-api-reference/ingestion-events/#send-an-annotation).

### Add annotations to a Grafana dashboard

1. In the upper-right corner of the dashboard, click the gear icon to open the **Settings** window.

2. Click the **Features** tab.

3. Select the **Annotations** check box to enable annotations.

4. On the **Add** tab, enter a name for the annotation and select **RackspaceMetrics** as the data source.

5. In the **Blueflood event tags** field, search for the annotation's tag.

6. Click **Add**.

The new annotation appears in Grafana.

### Retrieve annotations from the API &mdash;optional.

If you want to use the API to retrieve data about your annotations, use the following command:

    curl -i -X GET 'https://global.metrics.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/737305/events/getEvents?from=1452105863000&until=1452105883000' \
    > -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    > -H "Accept: application/json" \
    > -H "X-Auth-Token: AABlXo00elZk9FEtn2MGz8QQ9v3GD86AEZ_LbMe3yHyC43GE9pTFNXqVxYLq92FPwED0sDkYS8c1R222AWMS1y4nqTG3NmRofHmj4S0lfPsz3YXBTtFaXDac"

For more information about this operation, see
[Retrieve an annotation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/query-api-reference/query-views/#retrieve-an-annotation).

### Troubleshooting

If you don't see an event for which you created an annotation, ensure that all your API calls return
a `200 OK` response code.

If the response code is `403 Forbidden` and your API calls to other endpoints (like Rackspace
Monitoring) with the same tenant and authentication token works, check with the Metrics team
to ensure that the account is in the EAP program.

Also, verify that the dates of the events are within the time window specified by the query.
