Cloud Orchestration templates enable you to quickly and easily set up
server environments with different software configurations.

Because the list of templates expands frequently, the best way to see every
template that is currently available is to log in to the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) and click **Orchestration > Stack
Templates**.
