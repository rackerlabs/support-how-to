This article demonstrates how to reset a Cisco&reg; ASA VPN user password in the MyRackspace portal.

### Prerequisites

- Cisco ASA Firewall

### Limitations

- These instructions apply to only Cisco ASA firewalls. Other networking devices with VPN users cannot
  use automation to reset a user password.

- VPN user automation currently does not allow the following modifications:

    - VPN-filters
    - Group-lock
    - Framed IP addresses

If you need any changes included in the list of limitations, open a ticket so that Rackspace Support can process your
request manually.

### Reset the password

1. Log in to the MyRackspace portal.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Tickets > Create New Ticket**.

4. On the **Create New Ticket** page, click the **Subject** field, and in the drop-down menu, select 
   **VPN User Management - add, reset, delete VPN user(s) on firewall(s)**.

5. Select the **Reset VPN user on firewall** checkbox.

6. In the **Firewall** drop-down field, select the appropriate firewalls.

    - If you have high availability (HA) firewalls, you can select only one of the two HA firewalls
      in the drop-down menu. Automation adds the user to both HA firewalls.

    - If you need to reset the VPN user for all firewalls on the account, ensure that you select all
      the firewalls in this field.

7. Enter the VPN username in the **VPN Username** field.

    - The VPN username is case-sensitive and requires at least three characters.

    - Do not include a question mark (?) or a space ( ) in the VPN username field.

8. To create a custom password, clear the **Generate Random Password** checkbox.

9. In the password field, enter a custom password.

    - The password must have at least eight characters and include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

10. Click **Create Ticket** at the bottom of the page.

    After you create the ticket, the MyRackspace Portal redirects you to your list of tickets. Automation runs in the
    background during the ticket creation, typically taking less than a minute to complete. After you refresh your browser,
    the ticket **Reset VPN User Password on Firewall Request (from template)** status changes to **Confirm Solved**.

11. To confirm that the password is reset, open the ticket. The password appears in the most recent comment.
