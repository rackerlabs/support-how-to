This article outlines our support of software and server configurations for machines (virtual and physical) running a supported Linux&reg; operating system.

### Operating systems

The following operating systems are supported for both Dedicated and Managed Operations:

- CentOS&reg; 7
- Red Hat&reg; Enterprise Linux&reg; 8
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
- Ubuntu&reg; 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)

The following operating systems are supported only for Managed Operations:

- Debian&reg; 9 (Stretch)
- Debian 8 (Jessie)

**Note**: Rackspace makes every effort to align our support dates for operating systems with the manufacturer's support
dates. If a manufacturer decides to shorten the support life of an operating system, Rackspace might be forced to end
support sooner than originally anticipated. For full details on support life, see the
[Rackspace EOL Terms](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/eolterms).

### Web servers

The following types of web servers are supported in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apache | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| NGINX | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: Not all add-on modules are supported. Contact Rackspace Support for more information.

### Database servers

The following types of database servers are supported in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL and MariaDB | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Percona | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: Linux OS administrators handle basic database support topics. Advanced topics might require DBA support assistance.
PostgreSQL, MongoDB&reg;, and Oracle&reg; are not supported by Linux OS administrators. The Rackspace DBA team supports Oracle
and MySQL&reg;. PostgreSQL requests can be considered on a case-by-case basis. The Rackspace DBA team is available for support
consultation on database issues. Fees might apply. For more information visit our [DBA Services page](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/dba-services).

**Note**: Rackspace will install and support the official Oracle MySQL, MariaDB&reg; and Percona&reg; MySQL software from the vendor's repositories.

### File servers

The following file servers are supported in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vsftpd | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| NFS | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| CIFS (client) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| lsyncd | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: Although `lsyncd` is not strictly a file server technology, we commonly use it at Rackspace in place of NFS services
on cloud servers. Bidirectional data transfer with `lsyncd` is not supported.

### Mail servers

The following mail servers are supported in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Postfix | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Dovecot | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: By their nature, cloud servers have ephemeral IP addresses, which most email providers blacklist. Emails sent
from a cloud server must go through a third-party application such as [Mailgun&reg;](https://www.mailgun.com/). Rackspace
recommends [Rackspace Email Hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/email-hosting) for cloud environments.

### Application servers

The following authentication tools are supported in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memcached | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Redis | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Varnish | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: Rackspace does not support VCL customization for Varnish.

### Clustering

The following services are supported on Red Hat Cluster Suite&reg; (RHCS) in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| NFS | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Redis | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: RHCS is supported only on physical hardware platforms (not including OnMetal offerings). 
The DBA team and Linux OS administrators support Oracle on RHCS in tandem.

### Containerization technologies

 The following containerization technologies are supported:

 |   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
 | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | Docker| Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

 **Note**: Rackspace Support does not extend into the individual containers.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plesk | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: Plesk is supported only on dedicated Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS platforms.

### Antivirus

The following antivirus software is supported in the indicated areas:

|   | Installation | Configuration | Troubleshooting | Patching |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rackspace Managed Anti-Virus | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Note**: Rackspace requires the use of antivirus software on any configurations that use domain controllers and to assist in maintaining PCI compliance.

### Other services and technologies

Although we don't support all technologies, we do offer *reasonable endeavor* support, which extends our support into
offering alternative solutions. Reasonable endeavor support can include help from Rackspace partners and other third-party services.

- **API support**: All the support functions listed in the [API guides](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs) are supported.
- **Backups**: Rackspace provides solutions for file system and database backups including leveraging the use of open-source projects
  such as [Holland](https://docs.hollandbackup.org/). For more information, contact Support.
- **Cloud Files**: Integration with Cloud Files is supported via the API; however, no development
  support is offered to help use Cloud Files via the API.
- **DNS**: Rackspace supports the use of the public Rackspace name servers for DNS. Bind/named are *not* supported at this time.
- **Firewall**: Support is provided for iptables, Ubuntu operating system ufw, and fail2ban.
- **Load Balancing**: Cloud Load Balancers are supported.

### Third-party repositories

The Support team for Linux will, under reasonable endeavors and without warranty, configure repository access and install any packages
from the following list of supported repositories. Some of the following repositories are also mirrored locally to our data centers.

- [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)
- [IUS](https://ius.io/)
- [MariaDB (vendor)](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/#mirror=osuosl)
- [MySQL (vendor)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/)
- [NGINX (vendor)](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)
- [Percona (vendor)](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/installation.html#installing-percona-server-from-repositories)
- [Varnish (vendor)](https://www.varnish-cache.org/releases/install_redhat.html)

_When packages from 3rd party vendors are installed, customers are responsible for vendor escalation,
patching, and updates._
