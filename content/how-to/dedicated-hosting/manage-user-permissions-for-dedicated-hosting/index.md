This article describes user permissions for Dedicated Hosting and shows you
how to manage these permissions.

To manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) select **Account > Permissions**.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** area in the MyRackspace Portal and
modify another userâ€™s permissions, you must have either the **Account Administrator** permission or
the **Admin** permission. The **Account Administrator** permission grants the user unlimited access
to all sections of the MyRackspace Portal. The **Admin** permission (on a device or service)
grants the user the ability to access and manage the device or service.

If you can't find the information you need here, review the **FAQ** section on the left
for answers to common user permission problems.

### Categories of permissions

There are two types of permissions are available for Dedicated Hosting
accounts:

- **Direct permissions**: Grant the user direct access to
  account permissions, linked cloud accounts, devices, or services.

- **Effective permissions**: Are inherited as a result of their memberships in user and product groups.

**Note**: You can grant a user a combination of direct and effective
permissions. MyRackspace uses the highest level of permission granted.

### Methods for assigning permissions
To manage user permissions, log in to the MyRackspace
portal and then select **Account > Permissions**.

You can use the four tabs on the next page to assign permissions in the following ways:

- **Assign by User**
- **Assign by Product**
- **Manage Groups**
- **Global Permissions**

#### Assign by user

Allows you to select an individual and grant them direct or effective permissions
at the account level. You can also manage a user's access to associated cloud accounts,
devices, services, product groups, and group membership by selecting the tabs on the
**Assign By User** page.

To assign permissions by user, complete the following steps:

1. Select **Account > Permissions**.

2. Select **Assign by User**.

3. Select a user and select from one of the tabs to update the user permissions.

#### Assign by user group

Allows you to select a group of users and grant them:

- Permissions at the account level.
- Access to linked cloud accounts, devices, services, or **Product Groups**.

To assign permissions by user group, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Account > Permissions**.

2. Select **Assign by User**.

3. Select a group from the User Groups Column.

4. Select the checkbox next to the permissions you would like to assign to that group.

5. Click **Save Changes**.

This updates the permissions of all users in the selected group.

#### User permission types

The following table explains the different
permission options.

### Manage global permissions

The **Global Permissions** section lets you make changes across your
entire account.

**Ticketing Settings** enables you to control the tickets that your users have
permission to see when those tickets include one or more devices.

The following table shows the ticketing settings that you need for common
actions or views:
{{< table "table  table-striped table-bordered" >}}
| Ticketing setting  | Functionality |
|---------|--------|
| Flexible Ticket Viewing (default setting)     | Enables users to see tickets that include a device that they have permission to view. For example, if a user has access to device A, they see all of the tickets that include device A, even if another device is on the ticket. If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user can still see the ticket.   |
| Strict Ticket Viewing     | Requires users to have access to all of the devices on a ticket in order to see that ticket. For example, if a ticket includes device A and device B, then the user must have permissions to both devices to see the ticket. If the ticket later includes device C, to which the user has no access, the user can no longer see the ticket.   |

tasks with tickets:

| <b>View Tickets</b> or <b>Edit Tickets</b> permission   | View or include another user on an account ticket (a ticket that doesn't have a device or service associated with it).   |
