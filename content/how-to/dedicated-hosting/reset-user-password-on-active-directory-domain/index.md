in the MyRackspace portal.

### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace portal

   password.

2. In the top navigation bar, choose **Select a Product** > **Dedicated Hosting**.

4. Select the Subject field.

5. From the dropdown menu, Select **Reset User Password on Active Directory Domain**.

6. Enter the username and Domain of the user account for which you want to reset the password. 

   After the request has been completed, a secure password is automatically generated for this user
   and provided in the ticket. You can change this password later if desired.

7. Select **Create Ticket**.

   After the ticket is created, you are redirected to your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal.
   It typically takes a few minutes for the ticket creation process to complete.
