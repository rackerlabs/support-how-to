This article explains how to use a ticket template to reset the password for an
Microsoft&reg; Active Directory user in the MyRackspace portal.

### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login) with
   your username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, choose **Select a Product** > **Rackspace Dedicated**.

3. Select **Tickets** > **Create Ticket**. The **Create New Ticket** page displays.

4. Select the **Subject** field.

5. From the drop-down menu, select **Reset User Password on Active Directory Domain**.

6. Enter the **Username** and **Domain** of the user account for which you want
   to reset the password.

   After the request completes, the system generates a secure password
   automatically for this user and provides it in the ticket. You can change
   this password later.

7. Select **Create Ticket**.

   After the ticket generates, you see your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal.
   It typically takes a few minutes for the ticket creation process to complete.
