### Overview

Rackspace is working to make your multicloud experience as simple as
possible, and you've told us that the best way to do this is to unify the
way that you access and manage your accounts. We're working to make account
management seamless by unifying our login experience. This process will
involve multiple updates over the coming months as we build towards a single
solution. The first step in this journey was to ensure that your username meets the Rackspace uniqueness requirements by September 24, 2018.  The next step on this journey is unifying our login portals which simplifies the login process for My.Rackspace.com users starting on October 18, 2018.  

Over the past several months, many of our customers were notified that
they would need to update their usernames by September 24, 2018 in order to
meet the uniqueness requirements. If your username required updating and you
did not update it by September 24, 2018, Rackspace has automatically updated
your username to meet the new requirements.

### Changes to your MyRackspace username as of September 24, 2018

Your updated username is in the following format:

_**Current username + last 4 digits of your account number**_

The following example illustrates how Rackspace has created new usernames:

| Previous username | Account number | New username |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| johnsmith | 551234 | johnsmith1234 |

### MyRackspace login process

Beginning on October 18, 2018, Dedicated and Managed Services users can access their accounts at our unified login portal [https://login.rackspace.com](https://login.rackspace.com) or at the existing portal [https://My.Rackspace.com](https://My.Rackspace.com). No matter which portal you select, you no longer need to enter your account number as part of the login process. To log in, just enter your username and password.
