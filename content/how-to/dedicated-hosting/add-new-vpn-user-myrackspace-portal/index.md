Adding new client VPN users is now an automated task within the MyRackspace
Portal. This article describes how to add a new VPN user by using a ticket
template.

### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace Portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com) by using your
   username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Tickets > Create New Ticket**.

4. On the **Create New Ticket** page, click the **Subject** field, and in
   the drop-down menu, select **VPN User Management - add, reset, delete VPN user(s) on firewall(s)**.

5. Check the box next to **Create new VPN user on firewall**.

6. In the **Firewall** drop-down field, select the appropriate firewall(s).

   a. If you have high availability (HA) firewalls, you may select only one of the two
      HA firewalls in the drop-down menu. Automation adds the user to both HA firewalls.

   b. If you need to add the VPN user to all firewalls on the account, ensure
      you select all firewalls in this field.

7. Enter your desired VPN username in the **VPN Username** field.

   a. The VPN username is case-sensitive and requires at least three characters.

   b. Do not include the question mark (?) or a space ( ) within the VPN username field.

8. The **Generate Random Password** box is checked by default. If you want
   to add a custom password, uncheck this box.

   After the box is unchecked, the custom password field displays.

   This password must have at least eight characters with uppercase, lowercase,
   numbers, and special characters.

9. Click **Create Ticket** at the bottom of the page.

   After the ticket is created, you are redirected back to your ticket list in
   the MyRackspace Portal. Automation runs in the background while the ticket is
   created, which typically takes less than a minute to complete. After you
   refresh your browser, the ticket *Create New VPN User on Firewall Request (from template)*
   is in **Confirm Solved** status.

10. Retrieve the password for your new VPN user by opening the ticket. The
    password is in the most recent comment.

### Limitations

VPN user automation currently does not allow for the following modifications:

- VPN-filters
- Group-lock
- Framed IP addresses

If you need changes included in the list of limitations, open a ticket so that
Rackspace Support can process your request manually.
