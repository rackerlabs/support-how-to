Firewall Manager v2 is a new tool within the MyRackspace Portal. This article describes the tool and provides links to detailed articles about the Firewall Manager v2 features.

### What is Firewall Manager?

Firewall Manager, commonly referred to as the Firewall Control Panel (FWCP), is a self-service tool in the MyRackspace Portal. Firewall Manager enables you to immediately view and modify the configurations of your Cisco firewalls by securely connecting to them and executing the changes on your behalf. In many cases, you can use Firewall Manager to execute a change in less time than it takes to create a ticket.

### How do I find the Firewall Manager v2?

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com) by using your username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Network** > **Firewall Manager v2**.

### Firewall User Agreement

Rackspace requires each customer contact who attempts to use Firewall Manager to accept the Firewall User Agreement terms. These terms are prompted for each device, every 90 days. Only customer contacts who have edit or admin permissions on firewalls are permitted to make modifications. When the customer contact accepts the terms, a confirmation email is sent to the customer contact and primary contact. If the customer contact chooses not to accept the terms, that contact can only view their firewall configuration.
