This article explains how to create and manage Domain Name System (DNS) zones and records within the MyRackspace Portal and covers the following topics:

*    Create and delete DNS zones.
*    Modify zone Time to Live (TTL) settings.
*    Create and modify subdomains.
*    Import and export DNS zones.
*    Create, modify, and remove DNS records.

### Access DNS settings

To access DNS settings, log in to the [My Rackspace portal](https://login.rackspace.com/) and navigate
to **Network > Domains (DNS)**.

### Manage DNS zones

This section covers how to create or delete DNS zones.

#### Create a DNS zone

**Note:** The domains you add must already be registered before you can add them to the account. You can
choose to register a domain name through one of the many available registrars.

1. To access the zone creation page, click **Actions > Create Zone**.
2. In the field **Domains (one per line)**, enter the domain of the zone you want to create.
3. You must create at least one **A** record in the **Create Records** section when you add a new zone.
To modify the number of initial records you need, check or uncheck the box for the record. 
4. You can add a comment under **Comment**. Use this to describe the purpose of the new zone. It is not 
accessible publicly.
5. Click **Create New Zone** to finish adding the zone.

#### Delete a DNS zone

1. Click the zone domain name that you want to delete in the list of zones displayed. If you have a large 
number of zones, you can use the **Filter Zones** search box at the upper right to locate the necessary zone.
2. Click **Actions > Delete Zone**.

### Modify DNS zone TTL settings

When you modify DNS zone TTL settings, you can adjust the TTL for all zones or specifically for an individual zone.

#### Modify TTL settings for all zones

Start from the [DNS Zone List](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/domain/list) and perform the following steps:

1. Click **Actions > Modify all TTLs**.
2. Enter a new TTL in seconds, ranging from 300 to 864400.
3. Click **Modify All TTLs** to save the change for all zones.

#### Modify TTL settings for a single zone

Start from the [DNS Zone List](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/domain/list) and perform the following steps:

1. Click the zone domain name you want to modify. If you have a large number of zones, you can use
the **Filter Zones** search box at the upper right to locate the necessary zone.
2. Click **Actions > Modify Zone TTLs**.
3. Enter a new TTL in seconds, ranging from 300 to 864400.
4. Click **Modify All TTLs** to save the change for the zone.

### Manage subdomains

This section covers subdomains.

#### Create subdomains

Start from the [DNS Zone List](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/domain/list) and perform the following steps:

1. Click the zone domain name you want to associate with the subdomain. If you have a large number of 
zones, you can use the **Filter Zones** search box at the upper right to locate the necessary zone.
2. Click **Actions > Add Subdomain**.
3. Enter the subdomain.
4. Choose a target from the list.
5. Enter additional info based on the target.
6. Click **Add Subdomain** to save.

#### Modify subdomains

Start from the [DNS Zone List](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/domain/list) and perform the following steps:

1. Click the zone domain name associated with the subdomain. If you have a large number of zones, you can use the **Filter Zones** search box at the upper right to locate the necessary zone.
2. Click **Actions > Edit Subdomain**.
3. Click the desired subdomain.
4. Change the subdomain target by using the list.
5. Enter additional info based on the new target.
6. Click **Save Changes** to finish.

### Export DNS zones

When you export DNS zones, you can either export all zones or a specific zone.

#### Export all DNS zones

Start from the [DNS Zone List](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/domain/list) and perform the following steps:

1. Click **Actions > Export All Zone Files**.
   
   This begins the export of all zone files. 

2. After the export completes, a **.zip** file beginning with the account number is added to the file
manager containing **.txt** files for each zone in **BIND9** format.

**Note:** This process might take a while, depending on the number of zones.

#### Export a single DNS zone

Start from the [DNS Zone List](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/domain/list) and perform the following steps:

1. Click the zone domain name you want to modify. If you have a large number of zones, you can use the 
**Filter Zones** search box at the upper right to locate the necessary zone.
2. Click **Actions > Export Zone File**.

   This automatically downloads a **.txt** file named after the exported zone domain name in **BIND9** format.

### DNS records
