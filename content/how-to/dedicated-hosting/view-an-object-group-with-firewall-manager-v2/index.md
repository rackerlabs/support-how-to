Firewall Manager v2 is a MyRackspace Portal tool. This article describes how to
view object-groups, an easy-to-use feature that groups and sorts similar items,
such as IP addresses, ports, or protocols.

To learn more about the tool, see [Firewall Manager v2](/support/how-to/firewall-manager-v2).

### Why should I use an object-group?

Object-groups improve the organization and readability of the running
configuration for a firewall. A running configuration that is easy to read and
modify reduces the chances for misconfiguration and increases your ability to
troubleshoot issues quickly.

Firewall Manager v2 refers to object-groups as *IP groups*. You can view, create,
update, and delete any object-group on your firewall. For more information, see
the following articles:

- [Modify an object-group](/support/how-to/modify-an-object-group-with-firewall-manager-v2)
- [Delete an object-group](/support/how-to/delete-an-object-group-with-firewall-manager-v2)

### View object-groups

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/) by using your
   username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Dedicated**.

3. Select **Network** > **Firewall Manager v2**.

4. In the navigation pane on the left side of the panel, click the firewall for
   which you want to see object-groups.

5. Under **Rules** in the navigation pane, click **IP Groups**.

6. Scroll through or search the object-group list and click the appropriate
   object-group. The contents of the object-group display automatically.

Firewall Manager v2 organizes the object-groups in case-sensitive alphabetical
order. Therefore, object-group names with uppercase letters display before those
with lowercase letters. If you canâ€™t locate an object-group, search for the
object-group by using your browser search function.

You can also search the contents of an object-group. This feature enables you to
quickly determine whether an IP address or subnet exists within the specified
group. To use this feature, type an IP address or subnet IP in the search bar that
displays automatically when you click the group.
