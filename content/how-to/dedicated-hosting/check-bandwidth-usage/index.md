This article describes how to check the bandwidth on your account for multiple
devices by using the MyRackspace Portal.

### Prerequisites

Viewing this data requires specific device-level permissions. If you experience
issues viewing the bandwidth usage on your firewall device, ensure that you have
appropriate permissions on the device.

### Procedure (repeat as necessary)

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/) by using your user name and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Dedicated**.

3. At the top of the panel, select **Network > Bandwidth**.

   A bandwidth report for the current month displays. You can change the month shown by
   clicking the drop-down menu and selecting the month that you want to view.

From the top navigation bar, you can access other reports such as Device Bandwidth,
Bandwidth Data, or MRTG Graphs, where you can filter the information that you need.
