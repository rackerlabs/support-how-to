This article explains how to use a ticket template to add a new Active Directory user.

### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login) with your username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, choose **Select a Product** > **Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Tickets** > **Create Ticket**. The Create New Ticket page displays. 

4. Select the Subject field.

5. From the dropdown menu, Select **Create New User on Active Directory Domain**.

5. Specify a username for the account you want to create. 
   
   After the request has been completed, a secure password is automatically generated for this
   user and provided in the ticket. You can change this password later if desired.

6. Specify a domain for the user.
   
   Use the **Give this user Administrative or sudo permissions** checkbox to grant the user
   administrative or sudo permissions. This automatically adds the user to Domain Administrator groups.

   Use the **Additional Instructions** box to provide additional information such as user details or
   group membership permissions.

9. Select **Create Ticket**.

   After the ticket is created, you are redirected to your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal. It
   typically takes a few minutes for the ticket creation process to complete.
