### General

#### Where can I learn more about the service levels for Dedicated Managed Hosting?

You can find a comparison of the service levels on the [Managed Hosting
product page](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/service-levels).

#### Where can I find your SLAs?

  Conditions](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/managedterms)
- [Managed Hosting Services Terms and Conditions
  (Intensive)](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/intensiveterms)

#### Where can I read more about Rackspace's support lifecycle and terms?

You can find information about support lifecycles and terms on the [Extended
Lifecycle Support page](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/eolterms).

### Permissions

#### Why do I need to set up permissions?

Permissions enable you to determine the amount of access that your users have
in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com). Our Support teams review these
permissions to help determine user access when responding to support requests.

#### How do I manage permissions?

You manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) under **Account > Permissions** in the
subnavigation bar.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** section and modify another user’s
permission, you must have one of the following permissions:

  - **Account Administrator**: This permission grants a user unlimited access
    to every section of the MyRackspace Portal.

  - **Admin**: This permission (on a device or service) grants a user the
    ability to manage the device or service, as well as which users can access the device or service.

For details about how to manage permissions, see [Manage user permissions for
Dedicated Hosting](/how-to/manage-user-permissions-for-dedicated-hosting).
