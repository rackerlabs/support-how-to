### Permissions

{{<accordion title="Why do I need to set up permissions?" col="in" href="accordion4">}}

Permissions enable you to determine the amount of access that your users have
in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com). Our Support teams review these
permissions to help determine user access when responding to support requests.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="How do I manage permissions?" col="in" href="accordion5">}}

You manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) under **Account > Permissions** in the
subnavigation bar.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** section and modify another userâ€™s
permission, you must have one of the following permissions:

  - **Account Administrator**: This permission grants a user unlimited access
    to every section of the MyRackspace Portal.

  - **Admin**: This permission (on a device or service) grants a user the
    ability to manage the device or service, as well as which users can access the device or service.

### Troubleshooting

{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="What should I do if I can't see/access/manage a newly created device?" col="in" href="accordion3">}}

Because the system doesn't automoatically add new devices to product groups, users or user groups might not have
effective permissions to the device. Try adding the device to the correct product group.

For details about how to manage permissions, see [Manage user permissions for
Dedicated Hosting](/support/how-to/manage-user-permissions-for-dedicated-hosting).
