Read the following tips and how-to sections to help you achieve your goals with
Rackspace Auto Scale.

### How Auto Scale works

Rackspace Auto Scale is written in Python and calls the Rackspace Cloud Servers,
Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers, and Rackspace RackConnect v3 APIs. You can use all
Rackspace Cloud Server **create server** configuration parameters with Auto
Scale. For more information about Cloud Servers and Auto Scale, see [Rackspace Cloud Servers
documentation](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/v2/),
[Auto Scale GitHub documentation](https://github.com/rackerlabs/otter/tree/master/doc), and the
[Auto Scale GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/rackerlabs/otter/wiki).

### Invalid load balancers can prevent scaling

If you create a scaling group with more than one load balancer and one of the
load balancers is invalid (bad configuration), the scaling group never scales.
Auto Scale goes through the following process:

1. Create servers.
2. Add them to the load balancers.
3. Discover that one of the load balancers is invalid.
4. Delete the servers.
5. Remove the node from the valid load balancers.

### Delete scaling groups with missing servers

If you have manually deleted servers outside of Auto Scale, and you have
existing servers in the group, perform the following actions:

1. Update both the **minEntities** and **maxEntities** values to **0.**
2. Delete the group.

The following example illustrates those steps:

    PUT v1.0/tenantId/groups/groupId/config
    {"maxEntities": 0, "cooldown": 0, "name": "ready_to_be_deleted", "minEntities": 0, "metadata": {}}
    DELETE v1.0/{tenantId}/groups/{groupId}

### ServiceNet dependency can cause server creation to fail

When you configure your Auto Scale scaling group with a load balancer, you need
to include the Rackspace ServiceNet network as part of the launch configuration.
You cannot have only a private network in the launch configuration.

In a scale-up operation, Auto Scale tries to retrieve the ServiceNet IP address
of the server that it built to add it to the load balancer. If ServiceNet is
not part of the configuration, this action fails. To recover from this failure,
Auto Scale deletes the server that it built, which results in no active servers.

Avoid this problem by adding ServiceNet to the list of networks for the Auto
Scale group.

### Connect Auto Scale to a single Tsvld[svr] monitoring alarm

This tip shows you how to use a webhook to trigger an Auto Scale policy. It does
not explain how to create a check or an Auto Scale group.  For information about
creating checks and alarms, see the [Rackspace Monitoring Developer
Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/) or
the [Rackspace Monitoring Checks and
Alarms](/support/how-to/rackspace-monitoring-checks-and-alarms) article.

Modify the example values used for the configurations to meet your needs. These
values use the Auto Scale API to first create a webhook policy with the desired
capacity of five servers and a cooldown of three minutes, and then create a webhook
named *Rackspace Monitoring*. In steps 3, 4, and 5, you use the Rackspace
Monitoring API to do the following tasks:

- Create a notification by using the webhook URL created in step 2 
- Create a notification plan by using the webhook ID created in step 3
- Create an alarm that uses the notification plan created in step 4. 

You can do steps 3-5 through the [Rackspace Intelligence](https://intelligence.rackspace.com/) UI.

1. Create a webhook policy.

        POST/autoscale: v1.0//groups//policies
        [
        {
        "name": "set group to 5 servers",
        "desiredCapacity": 5,
        "cooldown": 1800,
        "type": "webhook"
        }
        }

2. Create a webhook for Rackspace Monitoring under the webhook policy.

        POST/autoscale: v1.0//groups/policies//webhooks
        [
        {
        "metadata": {},
        "name": "Rackspace Monitoring"
        }
        ]

3. Create a Rackspace Monitoring notification.

        POST/monitoring: /notifications
        {
        "label": "AutoScale",
        "type": "webhook",
        "details": {
        "url": <webhook_URL_from_AutoScale>
        }
        }

4. Create a Rackspace Monitoring notification plan.

        POST/monitoring: /notification_plans
        {
        "label": "Notification Plan 1",
        "critical_state": [
        <notification_ID_from_AutoScale>"
        ],

        "warning_state": [
        ],
        }
        "ok_state": [
        ]
        }

5. Create an alarm in Rackspace Monitoring.

        POST/monitoring: /entities//alarms
        '{
        "check_id": "<check_you_want_to_use>",
        "criteria": "<criteria_you_want_to_use>",
        "notification_plan_id": "<notification_plan_you_just_created>"
        }

### How to add or remove servers quickly

To quickly add servers to or remove servers from a scaling group, send a request
to change the value of the **minEntities** or **maxEntities** parameter, as
documented in the [Update scaling group
configuration](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#update-scaling-group-configuration)
section of the *Rackspace Auto Scale API Developer Guide.*

Following is an example request:

    PUT //groups//config
    { "name": "workers",
    "cooldown": 60,
    "minEntities": 5,
    "maxEntities": 100,
    "metadata": {
    "firstkey": "this is a string",
    "secondkey": "1", }
    }

You can remove a specific server from a scaling group by using the **delete server**
operation. For more information, see the [Delete server from scaling
group](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#delete-server-from-scaling-group)
section of the *Rackspace Auto Scale API Developer Guide.*

### maxEntities and minEntities settings affect scaling

If the number of active servers (desired capacity) in a scaling group is equal
to the configured **maxEntities** value during a scale-up, or equal to the
configured **minEntities** value during a scale-down, the call to execute the
scaling policy returns a `400 Bad Request` error response code with the message
`No change in servers`.

If the number of active servers in a scaling group is less than the
**maxEntities** value, the call to execute a scale-up policy returns a `200 OK`
response code and increases the number of servers to the **maxEntities** value
or the amount specified.

If the number of active servers in a scaling group is greater than the
**minEntities** value, the call to execute a scale-down policy returns a `200
OK` response code and reduces the number of servers to the **minEntities** value
or the amount specified.

**Note**: You can change the **minEntities** and **maxEntities** values for a
scaling group by using the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).
To do this, select **Auto Scale** from the **Servers** menu, select the scaling
group, and then, from the **Actions** menu, select **Edit Min / Max Servers**.

### Create and update the launch configuration setting

All Auto Scale API update requests completely replace all of the settings of the
updated item. The request sets any parameters not specified in the update request
to null or the default value. All requests, except update launch
configuration operation, validate that all required fields are provided. A
failed launch configuration update returns a `400 error response` code. The
following examples show how to create and update a launch configuration setting.
Creates uses a `POST` operation, and updates uses a `PUT` operation.

**Note**: Each user can have multiple Secure Shell (SSH) key pairs (name and key). The launch
configuration uses the admin user's SSH key pair name, usually the first admin
user found in the tenant. If there are multiple admin accounts in the tenant,
there is no guarantee as to which one is used. So it is best for there to be one
admin user in the tenant. You cannot change this restriction currently. There is
no option to specify a user to impersonate.

#### Create a scaling group with the launch configuration setting

This example creates a scaling group with load balancers, server metadata,
networks, and personality.

    POST /<tenant_id>/groups
    {
    "launchConfiguration": {
    "args": {
    "loadBalancers": [
    {
    "port": 8080,
    "loadBalancerId": 9099
    }
    ],
    "server": {
    "name": "autoscale_server",
    "imageRef": "0d589460-f177-4b0f-81c1-8ab8903ac7d8",
    "flavorRef": "performance1-2",
    OS-DCF:diskConfig": "AUTO",
    "metadata": {
    "build_config": "core",
    "meta_key_1": "meta_value_1",
    "meta_key_2": "meta_value_2"
    },
    "networks": [
    {
    "uuid": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
    },
    ],
    "uuid": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    "personality": [
    {
    "path": "/root/.csivh",
    "contents": "VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgZmlsZS4="
    }
    ]
    }
    },
    "type": "launch_server"
    },
    "groupConfiguration": {
    "maxEntities": 10,
    "cooldown": 360,
    "name": "testscalinggroup198547",
    "minEntities": 0,
    "metadata": {
    "gc_meta_key_2": "gc_meta_value_2",
    "gc_meta_key_1": "gc_meta_value_1"
    }
    },
    "scalingPolicies": [
    {
    "cooldown": 0,
    "type": "webhook",
    "name": "scale up by 1",
    <"change": 1
    }
    ]
    }

#### Update the launch configuration setting

This example shows how to update only the **flavorRef** and **name** parameters
without the remaining fields, and a successful 204 response code.

**Note**. The update operation overwrites all launch configuration parameters and
resets any parameters not specified in the update are to null or the default
value.

    PUT /<tenant_id>/groups/<group_id>/launch
    {<
    "type": "launch_server",
    "args": {
    "server": {
    "flavorRef": performance1-4,
    "name": "update_launch_config",
    "imageRef": "0d589460-f177-4b0f-81c1-8ab8903ac7d8"
    }}

Retrieve the launch configuration response. The load balancers, server's
metadata, personality, and networks are overwritten because of the preceding
update.

    GET /{tenant_id}/groups/{group_id}/launch (The load balancers, server's metadata, personality, and networks, are overwritten due to no load balancer, server metadata, personality, or networks, parameters being included in the update request)
    {
    "type": "launch_server",
    "args": {
    "server": {
    "flavorRef": performance1-4,
    "name": "update_launch_config",
    "imageRef": "0d589460-f177-4b0f-81c1-8ab8903ac7d8"
    }}}

#### Update the launch configuration eviction policy

When a launch configuration setting is updated, the servers that scale up after
the update use the latest launch configuration settings.

A scale-down that occurs after the launch configuration setting has been updated
deletes servers with the older launch configuration setting first. The only
exception to this is when servers are building. Auto Scale attempts to first
delete servers being built (pending) in a scale-down policy execution, then
servers with the older launch configuration setting, and lastly, any other
servers required by the scale-down policy.

### Delete servers

Deleting servers requires an Auto Scale Python call to the **Rackspace Cloud
Servers Nova-based API**. This section discusses how the Cloud Servers
API deletes servers and how to delete a specific server from a scaling group.

#### About the server "Active" state when deleting servers

When a scale-down policy executes, servers in the **Active** state are
deleted immediately because Nova, the software behind Rackspace Cloud Servers,
is aware of those servers. Auto Scale issues deletes for *Pending* servers first,
but Nova executes deletes for *Active* servers first. Thus, for a time, you
might see servers in the Control Panel that you have deleted; the
inter-programming communication and executions cause a lag. For example, if a
scale-up policy is executing to build five servers and, while the servers are
still building, a scale-down policy executes to scale down by two servers, you
might see five servers in the Control Panel until they finish building and
go into the Active state. Then, the system deletes the two servers.

#### Delete a specific server from a scaling group

You can remove a specific server from a scaling group by using the delete server
operation. For more information, see the [Delete server from scaling
group](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#delete-server-from-scaling-group)
section *Rackspace Auto Scale API Developer Guide.*

### Choose the flavor of a server for a scaling group

If you create an image of a server and use that image to create a scaling group,
you must choose a flavor in the scaling group that is equal to, or greater than,
the capacity of the flavor of the server used to create the image. For
more information about available server flavors, see
[Flavors](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/v2/general-api-info/flavors/)
in the Cloud Servers API documentation.

### Cloud bursting with Auto Scale and RackConnect

Auto Scale and RackConnect allow bursting into the public cloud from events in a
dedicated environment. Provision RackConnect by setting a metadata flag for
a RackConnect group in the Auto Scale launch configuration `metadata` section
(see the following example). When you set that section properly and Auto Scale
scales up a group, RackConnnect modifies the new server to disable its
public interface, and it begins receiving Private Cloud traffic from
the RackConnect load balancer. For more details, see
[Cloud Bursting using Auto Scale RackConnect and F5 Load
Balancers](/support/how-to/cloud-bursting-using-auto-scale-rackconnect-and-f5-load-balancers).

Example RackConnect metadata key and value pair for Auto Scale:

    "metadata": {
    "RackConnectLBPool": "MyRCPoolName"
    }

### Use Auto Scale to change the size of your General Purpose or work-optimized server

General Purpose and work-optimized servers do not resize as simply as Standard
servers. You have to go through a process to resize, detailed in [Upgrading
resources for General Purpose or I/O optimized Cloud
Servers](/support/how-to/upgrading-resources-for-general-purpose-or-io-optimized-cloud-servers),
to resize, and your server does not keep its IP address. You can use
Auto Scale to accomplish server resizing, keeping your IP address, and have it
happen dynamically in response to load. You pay for the higher-flavor servers
(for example, General Purpose and work-optimized) only when you need them.
When you don't need them, you can scale back down to lower-flavor servers (for
example, Standard), or keep the higher-flavor servers and just scale back the number of
servers in your group.

When you're ready to set up your scaling system to resize servers
dynamically, use the following guidelines.

1. Create two scaling groups: One with a lower flavor for the server
    setting in the **launchConfiguration** option and another with
    a higher flavor server setting in the **launchConfiguration** option.
    Configure both scaling groups with the same image and load balancer.

2. Create two policies for each scaling group:

      * One policy with **desiredCapacity**=0

      * One with **desiredCapacity**=2 or 3  (that is, scale up by 2
    or 3)

When you want a higher-flavor server, execute the scale-up policy on with the
higher-flavor scaling group and the **desiredCapacity=0** policy on the
lower-flavor group. Do the opposite when switching from a higher flavor to a
lower flavor.

This technique works well for single-server deployments. In fact, for smaller
deployments, the scale-up policy might just be +1 instead of 2 or 3.

One disadvantage of this technique is being charged for a load balancer when you
don't need it. However, you can offset that cost by the scaling down,
using lower-flavor (and less expensive) servers when the load is lighter.
