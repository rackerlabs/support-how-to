Cooldowns enforce a period of time between possible actions. Auto Scale has the
following types of cooldowns:

- Group Cooldowns
- Policy Cooldowns

    **Note**: Cooldowns are mainly relevant to event-based scaling policies
    because those policies are triggered by events that could occur before a
    required minimum cooldown period ends. However, a schedule-based policy will
    not override a cooldown and will not run during a cooldown period.

### Use a group cooldown

When you set a group **Minimum Cooldown**, you are restricting the ability of
the group to change in response to a policy. If you have configured event-based
policies, an event, or multiple events, to scale up or scale down could happen
before enough time has elapsed for the servers to fully deploy, in the case of a
scale-up; or for all transactions to finish, in the case of a scale-down. A
group cooldown ensures that at least a minimum amount of time passes before a
scale-up or scale-down triggered by an event-based policy, can occur.

For example, if you have three separate monitoring alerts for a server and each
alert is configured with a webhook to your Auto Scale group to trigger a
scale-up event if the alarm state goes critical, in the event of all three
monitoring alerts going critical at the same time, there could be three separate
but near-simultaneous requests to scale up. Having a minimum cooldown of 30
minutes would allow only one of the scale-up events to occur within 30 minutes,
the other two alerts would not be acted upon and do not iterate.

This feature is mostly used to ensure that servers being added in a scale-up
have enough time to fully deploy. The required minimum cooldown is not about how
many servers you may add at once, all servers are added at the same time. It is
about the complexity of the servers that you are adding. If the servers that you
add are very complex, they need a longer minimum cooldown period in order to
fully deploy. You should set the group minimum cooldown to the length of time
that it takes for one server to fully deploy.

### Use a policy cooldown

When you set a policy **Cooldown**, you are restricting the executability of the
policy by requiring a period of time to pass before the policy can be executed
again - even if it is triggered by an event. A policy cooldown controls how
often a single, specific, policy can be executed. For example, a scale-up policy
cooldown restricts how often the scale-up is executed despite being triggered by
an event, which allows scale-ups to fully deploy before another scale-up can
occur. Conversely, a scale-down policy cooldown can allow for the graceful
removal of servers by restricting the removal of too many servers at once even
if multiple scale-downs are rapidly triggered. Policy cooldowns allow you to
scale up fast and scale down slowly.
