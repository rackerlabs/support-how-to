**Previous section:** [Rackspace Cloud DNS - API Example](/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-dns-api-example)

For more information regarding the API, we encourage you to review the [Rackspace Cloud DNS API documentation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-dns/v1/developer-guide/).

### Supported Record Types

-   **A** - IPv4 address used to map hostnames to an IP address of
    the host.
-   **CNAME (Canonical Name Record)** - Points to another hostname that
    already has an A record associated with it. The CNAME record works
    like an alias.
-   **MX** - Used to specify a mail server that is responsible for
    accepting email messages on behalf of a recipient domain.
-   **SOA** - Specifies authoritative information about a domain,
    including the primary name server(s), the email of the domain
    administrator, the domain serial number, and TTL's.
-   **AAAA** - IPv6 address used to map hostnames to an IP address of
    the host.
-   **NS (Name Server)** - NS records indicate where the domain's DNS
    hosting services are located. It effectively delegates a domain to
    use a set of name servers.
-   **TXT** - This is a text record and is used primarily for SPF and
    DKIM records.
-   A SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record allows administrators to
specify which hosts are allowed to send e-mail from a given domain by
creating a specific SPF record in the public (DNS). Mail exchangers use
the DNS to check that mail from a given domain is being sent by a host
sanctioned by that domain's administrator.
-   DomainKeys (DKIM) is a method for associating a domain name to an
e-mail, thereby allowing an organization to take responsibility for a
message in a way that can be validated by a recipient.
-   **SRV** - Used to define the location (hostname and port) of servers used for a specific service.
