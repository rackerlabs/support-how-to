**Previous section:** [Rackspace Cloud DNS - Overview](/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-dns-overview)

Rackspace Cloud DNS automates and simplifies your domain name system
management and offers many of the features you need, including the following capabilities:

-   **REST-based API:** The Cloud DNS RESTful API lets you customize solutions to
    automate DNS management.

-   **Multiple record types:** A full list of record types is supported.

-   **Comprehensive management capability:** You can list, add, modify, and
    remove both domains and DNS records. You can also import and export domains.

-   **Domain delegation:** You can delegate a domain or a sub-domain 
    to a non-Rackspace name server by modifying the DNS record.

-   **Full TTL control:** You can easily update the default time to live (TTL)
    and resource record TTL values.

-   **Globally distributed Anycast DNS network:** Our internal network
    leverages Anycast to make DNS more reliable and resilient.

-   **Simplified migration:** Import and export features allow you to
    import or export a text list or BIND9-formatted file of managed
    domains and their configuration details into and out of your
    account.

The available management operations enable you to easily manage domains,
sub-domains, and records by using the RESTful API. Additionally, advanced
operations are available that allow you to easily manage mail servers and
zone delegation, as well as create SPF records.
