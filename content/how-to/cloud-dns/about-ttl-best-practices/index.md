When you specify Time to Live (TTL), you should be aware of the following important factors:

- The higher the TTL, the less frequently caching name servers need to query authoritative name servers.

     A higher TTL reduces the perceived latency of a site and decreases the dependency on the authoritative name servers.

- The lower the TTL, the sooner the cached record expires. This allows queries for the records to occur more frequently.

If youâ€™re going to make Domain Name System (DNS) changes, we suggest lowering the TTL to make the changes. If you're using DNS for failover, then lowering the TTL is a good idea as it takes less time to fail-over to another server.

Generally, we recommend a TTL of 24 hours (86,400 seconds). However, if you are planning to make DNS changes, you should lower the TTL to 5 minutes (300 seconds) at least 24 hours in advance of making the changes. After the changes are made, increase the TTL back to 24 hours.

**Note**: If DNS is used for failover, then you should probably keep the TTL at approximately 5 minutes all the time.

Change your TTL by using the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).
2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.
3. Select **Network > Cloud DNS**.
   A list of your domains displays.
4. Access the **Actions** menu from the gear widget next to the domain for which you want to change the TTL.
5. In the **Actions menu**, select **Edit Time to Live (TTL)**.
6. In the dialog box that opens, enter the TTL that you want to use. 
   You can select minutes or seconds for the units for the TTL.
7. Click **Save TTL**.
