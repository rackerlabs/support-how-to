A clone of a Cloud Block Storage volume is a copy made of an existing volume at
a specific moment in time. At a high-level, the volume cloning process does the
following:

- Creates a Logical Volume Management (LVM) copy on the *write* segment of your
    existing volume.
- Creates a new blank volume on a separate storage node.
- Directly transfers the volume data from the existing volume to the new volume.

The end result is an identical Cloud Block Storage volume that you can
immediately attach and use. You have the option to change the volume type prior
to beginning the volume clone process. Additionally, volume cloning also allows
you to increase the size of the new volume. The cloned volume must be the same
size or larger than original volume, the new volume cannot be smaller. Keep in
mind if you do use cloning to increase the size of your volume, be sure to
resize your file system (if supported) in order to take advantage of the new
larger clone.

Prior to the availability of the volume cloning feature, customers were
encouraged to utilize volume snapshots when a copy of a volume was needed. The
advantage to using volume cloning instead of snapshotting is that volume cloning
transfers your data directly between volumes, without the need to use a Cloud
Files snapshot as an intermediate step.

Volume cloning shares many similarities with volume snapshots. Namely, they both
utilize LVM as the primary copy and locking mechanism, and therefore, detaching
prior to cloning is recommended.

### Create a volume clone

It is a good idea to detach your volume from your server before you take a
volume clone. This is the safest method to prevent your server from writing
information while you are backing it up. That could get your data out of sync
and could create a problem. To detach your volume, see the instructions on
"Detach and delete volumes". You can always re-attach the volume by following
the "Attach volume to a server" steps on the [Create and attach a Cloud Block Storage volume](/support/how-to/create-and-attach-a-cloud-block-storage-volume)
article.

More advanced users may sync the file system in order ensure the integrity of
the data on your snapshots. Performing a sync will flush file system buffers and
write the data out to disk. If you are unfamiliar with how to sync your file
system, consider detaching your volume prior to snapshotting.

Steps to create a volume clone:

1. Navigate to the **Clone Volume** popup by either clicking the **Actions**
   button on the **Volume Details** screen.

2. Click the **Clone Volume** link.

3. Give the new volume a name. The default is the volume's name followed by the
   `-clone` suffix.

4. Specify the volume type and size.

5. Click the **Clone Volume** button.

6. After you click the **Clone Volume** button and are redirected to the new
    volume details page, you can safely reattach your volume.

### Delete a volume clone

1. Once created, a cloned volume can be treated like any other existing volume.

2. A CBS volume can be deleted by clicking **Delete Volume** from the actions
   button on the **Volume Details** screen.

### Frequently asked questions about volume cloning

{{< accordion title="How is cloning different from using a snapshot?" col="in" href="accordion1" >}}
A snapshot cannot be directly used as a volume. You need to create a volume from
the snapshot before you can attach it to your server. Snapshots are stored
redundantly in Cloud Files, however creating volumes from snapshots is a slower
process compared to creating a volume from a clone. If your application is time
sensitive, please consider using volume cloning instead. A volume Clone is
usable copy of the source volume and can be attached and used immediately.

{{< accordion title="Do I need to detach my volume prior to cloning?" col="in" href="accordion2" >}}
While not required, it is a good idea to detach your volume from your server
before you create a clone. This is the safest method to prevent your server from
writing data to the volume as a clone is being created and to avoid a situation
where you could end up with inconsistent data between a cloned volume and its
source volume. If you choose to leave your source volume attached prior to
creating a clone, you need to both sync current buffers and prevent future
writes during the actual clone call. More advanced users may choose to freeze or
sync their file system prior to creating a volume clone. Performing a sync will
flush file system buffers and write the data out to disk. If you are unfamiliar
with how to sync your file system, consider detaching your volume prior to
snapshotting.The volume cloning process works similar to creating a volume
snapshot via the API. Please note that as soon as the initial clone call returns
a 200 response, a local point in time snapshot has been created of your volume,
and you may continue using the original volume. The cloned volume will remain in
creating status until the source volume data has been fully copied to the new
clone.

{{< accordion title="Can I create multiple clones from a single volume simultaneously?" col="in" href="accordion3" >}}
No. Creating multiple clones simultaneously from the same volume will fail.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can I clone between regions?" col="in" href="accordion4" >}}
No. Volumes can only be cloned within the same region.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can I simultaneously snapshot and clone the same volume?" col="in" href="accordion5" >}}
No. Volume snapshots and cloning share the same locking mechanism, and therefor
cannot happen simultaneously on the same volume.

### Volume cloning constraints

You cannot create more than one clone per volume at a time. Snapshots and
cloning use the same locking mechanism, so a snapshot and clone of the same
volume cannot be running concurrently.
