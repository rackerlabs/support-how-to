If your Cloud Block Storage volume enters read-only mode, you need to
unmount the volume, run a file system check, then remount the volume to get it
back into read-write mode. This article shows you how to perform these tasks.

### Test write mode

First, you need to confirm that the volume has become a read-only volume. The
fastest way to perform this task is to attempt to create or edit a file. On a
Windows&reg; server, you can create a new file by using either the graphical
user interface (GUI), or the `New-Item` cmdlet in PowerShell&reg;, as shown in
the following example:

    New-Item c:\scripts\test_file.txt -type file

If the volume is in read-only mode, it returns an error.

On a Linux&reg; system, you can use the `touch` command, as shown in the
following example:

    touch test_file

Again, a read-only volume returns an error. If this occurs, you need to
unmount the server.

#### Unmount a volume from a Linux server

To unmount a volume from a Linux server, you first need to confirm how the
volume is presented to the cloud server by following these steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).
2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.
3. Select **Storage > Block Storage Volumes**.
4. Click on the block storage volume that you want to troubleshoot.
5. On the **Volume Details** page, note the value in the **Attached to** field.

At the command line, use the `df -h` command on your server to see how it is
mounted.

The output looks like the following example:

    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/xvda1      158G  1.1G  149G   1% /
    tmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm

Note the value that appears in the `Mounted on` column of the output.

Use the `cat` command to open the configuration file at **/etc/fstab**, as
shown in the following example:

    # cat /etc/fstab

Comment out the line or lines that begin with `/dev/xvdb1` (which are circled in the following image)
in **/etc/fstab** to prevent the volume from trying to mount on the next boot:

Run the `umount` command, using the `Mounted on` volume that you noted from
the output of the `df -h` that you used earlier, as shown in the following
command:

    # umount /dev/xvdb1/

The only output from this command is a command prompt.

# Unmount a volume from a Windows server

Use the following steps to unmount a volume from a Windows server:

1. In Windows **Server Manager**, select **File and Storage Services > Disks**.
2. Under the **Disks** window, right-click the Cloud Block Storage volume.
3. Select **Take Offline** from the pop-up menu. If the **Take Disk Offline**
   warning window displays, click **Yes**.

The Cloud Block Storage volume no longer displays as a drive under
**Computer**.

### Check the file system

After the volume is unmounted, run a file system check by using the following
command for your operating system:

- **Linux with ext3/4**: `fsck`
- **Windows**: `chkdsk`

Address any errors that the file system check generates.

### Mount the volume on Linux

To mount the volume on Linux, run the `mnt` command and assign the volume a
name for use on your server.

In the following example, the name of the volume is `cbsvolume1`:

    root@nosnetdfw:~# mkdir -p /mnt/cbsvolume1
    root@nosnetdfw:~# mount /dev/xvdb1 /mnt/cbsvolume1/

After the volume is mounted, the system does not send feedback. However,
you can check that your volume is ready by running the `df` command to
show your free disk space, as shown in the following example:

    root@nosnetdfw:~# df -h

Your new volume displays last in the list of available drives, as shown in the
following example:

    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/xvda1             40G  632M   37G   2% /
    none                  493M  136K  493M   1% /dev
    none                  498M     0  498M   0% /dev/shm
    none                  498M   36K  498M   1% /var/run
    none                  498M     0  498M   0% /var/lock
    none                  498M     0  498M   0% /lib/init/rw
    none                   40G  632M   37G   2% /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs
    /dev/xvdb1             99G  188M   94G   1% /mnt/cbsvolume1

Your drive is ready for use with your Linux server. However, you should
consider performing the steps in the following section to ensure that your
volume remains persistent after a server restart.

#### Make the volume persistent when the server restarts (Recommended)

We recommend that you add the volume to the static file system information in
your `fstab` configuration file. This step is optional, but it ensures that
your volume remains attached to your server after the server restarts.

Use the following steps to make the volume persistent:

1. If it is not already open, open the **/etc/fstab** configuration file. The
   following example command opens it in the `nano` text editor:

       root@nosnetdfw:~# nano /etc/fstab

   The file should look similar to the following example:

       #
       # /etc/fstab
       # Created by anaconda on Tue May 29 20:13:27 2012
       #
       # Accessible filesystems, by reference, are maintained under '/dev/disk'
       # See man pages fstab(5), findfs(8), mount(8) and/or blkid(8) for more info
       #
       /dev/xvda1          /               ext3    defaults,noatime,barrier=0 1 1

2. To add the volume to the static file system, add the following line beneath
   `/dev/xvda1`:

       /dev/xvdb1 /mnt/cbsvolume1 ext3 defaults,noatime,_netdev,nofail 0 2

    This line includes the `_netdev` option, which prevents attempts to mount
    the volume until all networking is running.

Now the volume persists on the server after server restarts.

### Mount the volume on Windows

Use the following steps to mount the volume on Windows:

1. Open the **Server Manager** window by right-clicking on the computer icon
   and selecting **Manage**.

   The Server Manager window displays.

2. In the left pane of the Server Manager window, click
   **File and Storage Services**.

3. In the left pane, click **Disks**.

   In the following example, a 100 GB volume is attached to the server. It is
   listed as **Offline**, it has 100 GB of unallocated space, and its
   partition size is **Unknown**. The volume is partitioned and formatted.
   It only needs to be remounted.

4. To bring the volume online, in the **Disks** pane, right-click the offline
   drive and select **Bring Online** from the pop-up menu.

When you open the **Computer** window now, the new Cloud Block Storage volume
displays like a regular hard drive. The volume is now ready to use.
