Rackspace Cloud Block Storage is a block-level storage solution that allows you
to expand the storage capacity of your Rackspace Next Generation Cloud Servers.
This means that you can increase your storage without increasing the size or
capacity of your server or by provisioning new ones. Once you mount and format
your drive, you can use it just like a regular hard drive attached to your
server. Or you can detach your block storage volume from one server and attach
it to another. Or you can delete your server, keeping your data intact and ready
for the next time you need it. And since you're leveraging the power of the
Cloud, you only pay for what you use. Cloud Block Storage offers you power and
ease with the kind of storage that works for you. For information on Cloud Block
Storage and Cloud Backup options on General Purpose servers, see
[Best Practices for Backing Up Your Data: Cloud Block Storage versus Cloud Backup](/support/how-to/best-practices-for-backing-up-your-data-cloud-block-storage-versus-cloud-backup).

There are two types of volumes that you can attach to your server:

- A standard speed option for customers who just need additional storage on
    their Cloud server
- A high performance option for databases and high performance applications,
    leveraging solid state drives for speed

Both types are priced per gigabyte (GB) of storage and not by input/output
operations per second (IOPS), which can be difficult to predict or control.

### Uses of Cloud Block Storage

Cloud Block Storage has the following use cases:

- Mount a drive to a server to scale storage without paying for more compute
    capability.
- Add standard speed storage for customers who just need additional storage on
    their server.
- Add high performance storage for databases and high performance applications,
    leveraging solid state drives for speed.
- Detach your block storage and delete your server, keeping your data available
    and your costs down, because you only pay for what you use.
- Re-attach your block storage volume and move data from one server to another.

### Access Cloud Block Storage

Access Cloud Block Storage either through the GUI interface of the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/) or through the API. This product
introduction walks you through Cloud Control Panel access. If you prefer to
interact with Cloud Block Storage programmatically, view the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-block-storage/v1/developer-guide/).

### Limits of Cloud Block Storage

Cloud Block Storage has the following limits:

- 50 GB to 1 TB for SSD volumes.
- 75 GB to 1 TB for SATA volumes.
- 14 volumes max / server - operating system (OS) dependent.
- 10 TB of SATA and 10 TB of SSD in each region -  This is the default for all
    new customers. Customers can request limit increases if more capacity is
    needed over the default limits. Please contact Rackspace Support, your
    Account Manager, or your Service Delivery Manager for more information.

### Cloud Block Storage terminology

You may run across some unfamiliar terms in this Getting Started Guide. The
following list gives definitions for common terms that Cloud Block Storage uses:

- **Instance**: An instance is a virtual machine that runs inside the cloud.
- **Instance type**: An instance type describes the compute, memory and storage
    capacity of Nova computing instances. In layman's terms, this is the size
    (in terms of vCPUs, RAM, and so forth) of the virtual server that you will
    be launching.
- **Region**: The location of your server and storage volumes. You should create
    your block storage volumes in the same data center as your server to avoid
    bandwidth fees.
- **Snapshot**: A snapshot is a point in time copy of the data contained in a
    volume.
- **Volume**: A volume is a detachable block storage device. You can think of it
    like a USB hard drive. It can only be attached to one instance at a time.
- **Volume type**: The volume type is the type of a block storage volume. There
    are two types: SATA for standard performance and SSD for high performance.
