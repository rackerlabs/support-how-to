**Previous section:** [Learn about Role Based Access Control
(RBAC)](/support/how-to/overview-role-based-access-control-rbac)

The account owner implements Role Based Access Control (RBAC) by adding users to the account and assigning roles. This article is intended to guide account owners through this process by using the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).

For information about setting up RBAC through the API, see the [Rackspace Identity API Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/).

**Note:** It is possible to assign a mix of multiple-product roles and per-product roles to one user through the API. The most permissive role determines the user's level of access.

### Account Credentials

Rackspace recommends that you change the account password before adding new users to the account.

When new users are created, a temporary password is assigned to
them. They should change the temporary password at their first login.

Also, new users receive an email from Rackspace notifying them that they have been added to the account. They receive information on how to sign up for an account in the email.

### Create New Users

To create a new user, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).
2. In the upper-right corner of the control panel, click **Account > User Management.**

4. Enter information in the **Create a User** section as shown in below image.

5. Select a **Contact Type** to assign to the user. RBAC has the following
   contact types:

   -  **Technical**
   -  **Administrative**
<img width="275" alt="MultiAccountRBAC4" src="MultiAccountRBAC4.png">
   These contact types are for reference only. They do not affect the user's
   permissions.

6. Click **Create User**.

7. On the page that opens, in the **Rackspace Account Permissions** section, you can either assign the user the **Account Administrator** role, or assign roles for the **Manage Users** area, the **Billing and Payments** area, the **Tickets** area, or **Product Access** separately.

   To assign a user the account administrator role, click the toggle button next to **Account Administrator**.

   Alternatively, to assign different permissions for different areas, scroll to the **AREA** section and select the **PERMISSION** that you want to assign by using the pencil menu to the right of each area.

8. Optionally, in the **Product Permissions** section, assign product permissions to the user. Click tab for a product, and then **Edit** the **PRODUCT ACCESS**.

The **Rackspace Cloud** tab enables you to assign either permissions for all Rackspace Cloud products, or per-product custom roles.

   **Note**: For optimal product interaction, see the "Suggested role configurations" section of this article.

   To assign per-product custom roles, choose **Custom** under **PRODUCT ACCESS**. A list of Rackspace Cloud products appears. The default role for each product is **NONE**. To change the default value, select either **ADMIN**, **OBSERVER**, or **None** for the product.

   **Note:** Depending on the roles assigned, the Control Panel view is different for each user.

   **Note:** After a user is assigned a custom role, that custom role cannot be modified. However, if the user is later assigned the account administrator role at the account level, that action overwrites all product-level custom roles.

### Suggested Role Configurations

Rackspace recommends the following custom role configurations for optimal product interaction.

{{< table "table  table-striped table-bordered" >}}
| Product  | If | And | Then |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Cloud Load Balancers     |   A user has been assigned any Cloud Load Balancers role.   |   n/a   | In Cloud Servers, give the user the <strong>Observer</strong> role (minimum action).   |
| Cloud Load Balancers     |   A user wants to add a node by using the <strong>Nodes > Add Cloud Servers</strong> option in the Cloud Control Panel.   |   The user has been assigned any Cloud Load Balancers role. | In Cloud Servers, give the user any role.   |
| Cloud Databases   |   A user wants to create a backup in Cloud Databases.  | n/a | In Cloud Files, give the user the <strong>Admin</strong> role. |

### Rackspace Customers With Multiple Accounts

Rackspace customers with more than one account might want to allow the same user to access each account. In this situation, the account owner must configure that user with a different username for each account. The following graphic illustrates this scenario.
