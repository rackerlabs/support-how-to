Account switching allows you to switch between Rackspace accounts. The **Remember Me** option
displays up to five remembered users appear on the **User** menu, making account switching for
Dedicated and Managed Hosting services seamless and easy. However, you might need to add or delete users
to be more efficient.

The following sections describe how to add and delete users from an account.

### Add user

1. Login to the [Rackspace portal](login.rackspace.com).
2. Select the **Remember Me** checkbox to add the user profile to the **User** menu.

### Delete user

1. Click **Log out** on the **User** menu.
2. Navigate to the [Rackspace portal](login.rackspace.com).
3. Click **Edit** under the **Pick a Login** box.
4. Click the delete icon beside the user you want to delete.
5. Select **Done** to save your changes.

**Important**: Standard security policies still apply, and the system
may occasionally prompt you for a password.
