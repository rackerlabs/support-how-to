Sometimes, such as when a user leaves the company or the company or project
name changes, you need to change the primary user, also known as the *account owner*,
for Rackspace Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts through the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

**Note**: Only the current account owner can assign a new account owner.

When you change the account owner, the following events occur:

- You must select the new or promoted user from existing users on the account.
  The selected user becomes the primary contact and has full control over the
  account.
- The former or demoted primary user is set as an Administrative contact type
  and given basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Identity permissions. You
  might need to set up RBAC permissions for the demoted user, depending on the
  use case.

### Change the account owner

Use the following steps to change the account owner through the Cloud
Control Panel:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **ACCOUNT** next to your user name in
   upper-right corner and click **Account Settings**.

3. Click **Update** next to **Account Owner**.

4. In the list of available users, click the radio button for the user that
   you want to assign as the new account owner.

5. Add the account owner's address and click **Submit**.

6. When prompted to confirm the account update, type **CONFIRM** in the text
   box and click **Complete**.
