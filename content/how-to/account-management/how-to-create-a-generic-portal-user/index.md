This article describes how to create a generic user for our Rackspace portal.

When creating portal users on your account, it is important that every user has their own login credentials to be properly verified. We understand that sometimes you might have an IT team or group of users where it might be easier to create a generic user account (ex: IT Support). If that is the case, you need to make sure that the CONTACT name of your user is generic. Per our verification policy, we cannot accept PINs from anyone other than the contacts who are listed. Therefore, if you need a group user, the group name will need to be listed as the CONTACT name. Please see the instructions listed below on how to create a generic user depending on your type of account.

### Dedicated Account Steps
