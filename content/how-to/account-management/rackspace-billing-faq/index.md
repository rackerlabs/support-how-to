{{< accordion title="How am I billed for Rackspace services?" col="in" href="accordion1" >}}

Many of our services follow a utility pricing model and are billed for
hourly usage each month on the anniversary date of the account creation.
Charges on invoices are based on service usage since the last invoice
date. Details about our product pricing are located on our [Cloud Pricing Page](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public-pricing/).

{{< accordion title="When am I billed for Rackspace services?" col="in" href="accordion2" >}}

When you sign up for products under the Managed Infrastructure or Managed
Operations SysOps service level, your credit card is charged a US $1.00
authorization charge to confirm that it is an active card. The amount of
the authorization charge is refunded to your card within 24 to 72 hours.

Thirty days after you sign up, your first invoice is processed. Your
charges consist of service usage accrued within the first 30 days.

After the first billing cycle, you are billed every month on the same
date that you first signed up for service.

{{< accordion title="How can I estimate my monthly bill?" col="in" href="accordion4" >}}

{{< accordion title="Can I pay in advance?" col="in" href="accordion5" >}}

If you meet the minimum requirements for our Commitment Pricing Program,
you can prepay based on a commitment pricing contract for your account. Any
usage beyond the minimum commitment amount is invoiced at the utility rate on
the monthly date of your account's anniversary. For example, if your account
was created on the 25th of the month, you will be billed monthly on the 25th.
You can find more information about the Commitment Pricing
Program on the [Cloud Servers Discount
page](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/discounts/).

{{< accordion title="What are the separate charges and minimums that are applied to Cloud Servers pricing?" col="in" href="accordion11" >}}

The listed prices for Cloud Servers include both *raw
infrastructure* and *managed service* charges. The price is split to
show what you are paying for when you partner with us.

-   The raw infrastructure price can be contrasted with what other
    hosting companies charge for a cloud server. It covers the
    infrastructure of the hosted server.
-   The managed service price applies to the support
    that we offer on top of our infrastructure. This *Service Level
    Rate* varies based on the service level that you choose for your
    cloud account.

The Service Level Rate *minimums* are based on the service level that you
choose for your cloud account. The minimums represent the minimum
monthly charge for the service. If the cost of the resources that you use in
a month exceeds the minimum, the Service Level Rate minimum does
not apply. If your costs for a month are less than the minimum, the
difference between your usage costs and the Service Level Rate minimum
are added to your bill.
{{</ accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Why am I being billed for a service when I'm not using it?" col="in" href="accordion12" >}}

Billing begins the moment that you provision a service or server on your
account. You are charged for servers, load balancers, and services as long as
those resources remain allocated to your account, even if they are not in use
or are disabled. This is because we have allocated resources for your
exclusive use that cannot be reserved by other customers.

After you delete the server, load balancer, or service from your
account, its resources are available for someone else to use, and you are no
longer billed for them.

Follow the process outlined in the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://login.rackspace.com) to delete your cloud servers and services. To cancel Rackspace support for Azure,
create a ticket for our Billing team.

{{< accordion title="Am I still charged if my servers are suspended?" col="in" href="accordion13" >}}

According to the Rackspace [Cloud Terms of
Service](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos), "If the
suspension was based on your breach of your obligations under the Agreement,
then we may continue to charge you the fees for the Services during the
suspension."
{{</ accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Am I still charged if my server goes down?" col="in" href="accordion14" >}}

The Rackspace [Cloud Terms of
Service](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos) explains
when customers are entitled to credits.
{{</ accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="I don't agree with my bill. How can I dispute a charge?" col="in" href="accordion15" >}}

You can create a ticket via the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/) with the details of your dispute. One of
our account managers will review the ticket. A credit is granted only if there
is an error related to our billing system or there is a service error
according to your service level agreement (SLA).
