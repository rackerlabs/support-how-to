As part of our OS Billable Services offering for Reasonable Endeavors, Rackspace
enables our engineers to extend additional help to customers beyond our
[Spheres of Support](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/linux-spheres-of-support-for-dedicated-and-managed-ops)
for an additional fee. With Reasonable Endeavors OS Billable Services for Linux&reg;, engineers
can allocate more time to these unsupported requests where historically, they had to
reject many of these requests due to time constraints and lack of resources.

### Criteria and guidelines

The following criteria and guidelines apply to Reasonable Endeavors OS Billable Services
for Linux:

* We bill Reasonable Endeavors based on actual time spent at the rate of $250.00 USD per
  hour with a minimum of one hour.
* All parties agree to the terms and conditions highlighted during the intake process
  before beginning the work.

**Note**: These requirements enable us to provide customers with the best and most
consistent experience possible.

### Restrictions and limitations

Reasonable Endeavors have the following restrictions and limitations:

* We require a review period of three business days to bring any related issues to our
  attention.
* Rackspace won’t provide ongoing support for completed requests after the three business
  day review period.
* Rackspace won’t proactively monitor or troubleshoot any issues that might arise after
  the requested task is completed or with the task itself.
* Rackspace reaches out before proceeding if a request takes longer to complete than
  initially estimated.
* Rackspace reserves the right to not proceed with any specific customer requests that
  might negatively impact customer environments.
* Completion time is subject to change because of updated circumstances or environment.
  One Racker's task completion time isn't an indication of another Racker's completion
  time, even if the tasks are similar.
* Not all Reasonable Endeavor requests are the same, and every task is subject to an
  in-depth review. Just because a Racker agreed to take on a Reasonable Endeavor request
  for a customer in the past doesn't mean another Racker can or will do the same for a
  new request. Performance of requested work depends on the availability of a Racker with
  expertise or knowledge of the unsupported request.
