**Previous section:** [RackConnect v2.0 requirements](/support/how-to/rackconnect-v20-requirements)

**Applies to:** RackConnect v3.0 and RackConnect v2.0

RackConnect&reg; is compatible with our dedicated Managed,
dedicated Intensive, cloud Managed Operations, and cloud Managed
Infrastructure service-level offerings, giving you the ability to select
the level of support that you need to properly manage your
hybrid environment. Your dedicated and cloud support teams are your
first points of contact for any RackConnect issues that you encounter.

Additionally, RackConnect leverages your existing cloud and dedicated
service-level agreements to provide you with support for your hybrid
environment, and RackConnect does not include different service-level
agreements than what you already have in place. In some cases, you might
have different levels of support between your dedicated and cloud
environments. For example, you might have dedicated Intensive service-level support for your dedicated devices, and Managed Infrastructure
service-level support for your cloud servers. This means that although
your dedicated Intensive and cloud Managed Infrastructure support teams
can help you isolate and resolve issues within your cloud and dedicated
environments, they will not be authorized to log in to your cloud
servers to investigate issues.

As always, your service experience is our top priority. To ensure the
best possible level of support, we recommend that you use our dedicated
Intensive and cloud Managed Operations service levels for your
RackConnect hybrid solution. These service levels provide you with
higher levels of support for your hybrid environment.

For more information about our support service levels, see [Dedicated service levels](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/service-levels/) and
[Cloud service levels](https://www.rackspace.com/openstack/public/service-levels).
