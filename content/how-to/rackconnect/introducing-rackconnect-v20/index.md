**Applies to:** RackConnect v2.0

**Important**: The beginning of each RackConnect article includes an
**Applies to** label to indicate whether the contents apply to
RackConnect v2.0, RackConnect v3.0, or both.

**Note:** This article is a high-level overview of RackConnect v2.0. For
more technical information about RackConnect, see [RackConnect v2.0 requirements](/support/how-to/rackconnect-v20-requirements).

RackConnect gives you the freedom to choose the best platform for your
applications by unifying the breadth of the Rackspace portfolio into a
single solution.

RackConnect is a unique solution designed for customers who require the
flexibility and elasticity of the cloud, and the enhanced security and
performance characteristics of traditional hosting&mdash;the best of both
worlds. In essence, RackConnect enables customers to realize the power
of hybrid hosting.

-   Choose an F5&reg; BIG-IP&reg; Local Traffic Manager or a Cisco&reg; ASA firewall
    to connect your traditional hosted infrastructure to the
    Rackspace Cloud.

-   Scale on demand as cloud servers are automatically added to your F5
    BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager load balancer.

-   Connect the Rackspace Cloud with your data center or existing IT
    infrastructure by using an encrypted VPN tunnel.

-   Define network security policies in the customer portal, which are
    automatically applied and managed across your firewall, load
    balancer, and cloud servers.

-   Add [Cloud Block
    Storage](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/block-storage/) for
    easy scalability.
