**Previous section**: [RackConnect v2.0](/support/how-to/rackconnect-v20)

This article describes how to access the RackConnect Management Interface for RackConnect v2.0 users.

**Note:** RackConnect v3.0 does not use network policies, and so the management interface is not accessible in the MyRackspace Portal for RackConnect v3.0 users.

You can access the RackConnect Management Interface from the
[MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/).

To view your RackConnect configuration, click **Network > RackConnect**.

On the RackConnect page, you can add a Cloud account to your RackConnect
configuration, view public IP addresses for your connected cloud
servers, set network policies for your cloud servers, and view the
progress of all automation.

The interface displays the servers on your RackConnect account with
colored status indicators.

-   Green = Deployed
-   Blue = Deploying
-   Red = Failed
-   Yellow = Removing
