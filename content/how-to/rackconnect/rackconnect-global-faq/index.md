#### What is RackConnect Global?

RackConnect&reg; Global is a software-defined, multi-cloud interconnection
platform that links Rackspace customers with other Rackspace data centers,
third-party data centers, and third-party clouds via direct, private, low-latency,
virtual connections. All traffic flowing between every endpoint
avoids the public Internet, and instead, rides the Rackspace private backbone.

#### Why should I care about avoiding the public Internet?

The average enterprise currently uses at least five different multi-cloud
platforms. A typical mix includes on-premises private clouds, colocation,
hosted private cloud, public cloud, and multiple Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
offerings. Data stored and processed in each must flow from one to the other
rapidly and securely. Over two-thirds of data traffic travels east-west
between clouds, rather than north-south to the end user. This flow of
information is susceptible to intrusion. If an adversary can make their way into the east-west traffic, there's a good chance they could make their way easily across
the network and into all of your platforms.

#### How does RackConnect Global work?

RackConnect Global is an “ecosystem of ecosystems.” Rackspace has linked the
leading interconnection exchanges and cloud providers to our proprietary
backbone. After you’ve connected with the Rackspace backbone via a Rackspace
data center or edge location (backbone routers in third-party connectivity-rich colocation sites), you can spin up virtual connections across the
Rackspace footprint as well as Megaport and the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric.
This enables Rackspace to provide multiple paths for connecting with all your
cloud and colocation providers wherever they are across the globe for an
integrated hybrid cloud experience.

For more details, see [https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/global](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/global).

#### Who is the audience for RackConnect Global, and what pain points does it solve?

Any company that uses at least one Rackspace service (colocation, dedicated
hosting, server virtualization, private cloud, managed public cloud, or
application services) and at least one other IT service provider, should find
RackConnect Global of tremendous value. The private, secure, low-latency
solution saves traffic flowing between all connected environments&mdash;Rackspace
and third-party&mdash;from riding the insecure and bogged down public Internet.
Compared to procuring long-term individual point-to-point connections from a
telecommunications carrier between each of your clouds,
RackConnect Global Any-to-Any connectivity is significantly more cost-effective,
flexible, and easier to implement.

#### What are the primary use cases?

RackConnect Global is the primary mechanism for linking multiple Rackspace
services across different locations. It also enables customers to link
services deployed in Rackspace data centers with third-party cloud
environments regardless if Rackspace manages them. RackConnect Global is also
frequently used to tether Rackspace services with third-party colocation
facilities and network carriers.

RackConnect Global is of particular value for facilitating multi-cloud
strategies. Because the public cloud is incrementally more expensive (due to
the scalability and elasticity it affords), it’s prudent to keep as much of a
workload as possible deployed within a static private cloud environment and
only “burst” into the dynamic public cloud when additional resources are
required. RackConnect Global is ideal for ensuring private clouds and borrowed
public cloud resources across any number of providers all function together as
a seamless and secure environment from an end user standpoint.

#### What are the connectivity options for users to establish connection via RackConnect Global?

Users can connect external environments via the following means:

-  Physically cross-connect with Rackspace edge location routers within same
   colocation environment
-  As a participant on the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric or Megaport cloud
   exchange
-  Procure a local loop from a telecommunications carrier to the most
   proximate RackConnect Global-enabled Rackspace data center or edge location

#### What speeds are supported?

RackConnect Global supports connectivity speeds of 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200
Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, and 10 Gbps.

#### Is the traffic secure?

Use RackConnect Global to securely transfer data without going over the
Internet, using a private circuit that isn’t shared with others&mdash;for an
additional layer of protection for your business data and apps. The service
does not provide encryption of any sort. It is purely an MPLS VPN connection.
The traffic rides all the way through the Rackspace backbone (the network that
interconnects Rackspace regions and provides connectivity outside of
Rackspace) without hitting the Internet path and is inherently secure.

#### Does the service have an SLA?

Yes. RackConnect Global includes a 99.9% Connectivity Uptime Guarantee,
industry-leading SLAs, and the commitment to 24x7x365 service and support
that’s at the core of what we do. (Rackspace guarantees that the termination
endpoint for the RackConnect Global Service virtual circuit can accept
connections 99.9% of the time in any calendar month, provided that there are
two or more virtual circuit termination endpoints at the Rackspace data center
location.) You can read the agreement at [https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/rackconnect-global-regionlink](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/rackconnect-global-regionlink).
