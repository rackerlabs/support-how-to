The following list provides some data and configuration directories commonly chosen for 
Cloud Backup for a Linux&reg; server:

- **/etc/**
- **/home/**
- **/root/**
- **/var/spool/cron**
- **/var/log/**
- **/var/www/html/** (If Apache is using the default `DocumentRoot`.)
- **/var/ftp/pub/** (If `vsftp` is using the default settings.)

We don't support or recommend backing up active databases or directories such as **/var/lib/mysql**. 
Because the live database is actively writing to these directories, the files can't be effectively 
backed up. 

To back up a database, see the article on [backing up databases](/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-backup-backing-up-databases).

Instead of listing specific files and directories to back up, you can configure Cloud Backup to back up 
the entire file system and exclude individual files or directories as needed.
