This article describes how to identify which network interfaces on a LinuxÂ® 
server are associated with which Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

### IPv4

You can get a list of the network interfaces and IPv4 addresses on your server by 
running the following command:

    /sbin/ip -4 -o a | cut -d ' ' -f 2,7 | cut -d '/' -f 1

The output lists the interface names on the left and the associated IP addresses on the right.

    lo 127.0.0.1
    eth0 68.207.142.192
    eth1 10.173.3.121

### IPv6

For IPv6, you can run a similar command but use "-6" in place of "-4":

    /sbin/ip -6 -o a | cut -d ' ' -f 2,7 | cut -d '/' -f 1

Here, too, the interface names are on the left, and the IP addresses are on the right.

    lo ::1/128
    eth0 2001:4801:7817:72:bc18:4779:ff10:1653
    eth0 fe80::be76:4eff:fe10:1633
    eth1 fe80::be76:4eff:fe10:12ab

### Full output

To get all the information about your network interfaces in one place, run the following command:

    /sbin/ip a

The detailed output lists each interface, any associated IP addresses, their network prefix 
length, their scope, and many other details.  For more information, check the 
`man` page for the `ip` command by using the following command:

    man ip
