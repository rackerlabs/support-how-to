You can attach (add) or detach (disconnect) networks from Cloud Servers by
using the [Cloud Networks API](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-networks/v2/)
or the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

This article describes how to attach and detach networks by using the
Cloud Control Panel. Be aware that if you attach networks to or
detach them from a cloud server, you might experience a brief
interruption in traffic hitting your cloud server while the
system resets networking on the server. This usually lasts less
than a minute.

### Exceptions&mdash;OnMetal and RackConnect

OnMetal servers cannot attach and detach networks. For OnMetal, you
must specify all desired networks at the initial build time. While you
can attach and detach networks from RackConnect servers (API only),
Rackspace does not support these actions, which will break Internet
connectivity on your RackConnect servers.

### Attach a network

1.  Log in to the Cloud Control Panel at
    [mycloud.rackspace.com](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

2.  On the **Cloud Servers** page, click the server to which you want to
    attach a network. The **Details** page for that server displays.

3.  Scroll to the **Networks** section and click **Add Network**.

    A pop-up box lists the networks that you can attach to this
    server.

4.  Select a network and click **Add Network**.

    You can also create a new cloud network and attach it to the
    server.

    **Note**: Adding networks might take several minutes.

    After the network is attached, it displays in the list of
    networks for that server.

    **Note**: Disconnecting networks might also take several minutes.


### Detach a network

You can detach a network from the server on the same page under the
**Networks** section. Refer to the
[Cloud Networks Developer Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-networks/v2/developer-guide/#document-overview/consequences-of-detaching)
before you detach Public or ServiceNet interfaces from cloud servers.

1.  Log in to the Cloud Control Panel at
    [mycloud.rackspace.com](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

    **Note**: Disconnecting networks might take several minutes. 

2.  On the **Cloud Servers** page, click the server from which you want to
    detach a network. The **Details** page for that server displays.

3.  In the **Networks** section, click the gear icon next to the network
    that you want to detach.

4.  In the pop-up box, click **Disconnect Network**.

After the network detaches from the server, it no longer displays
in the networks list for that server.
