{{<accordion title="Does RackConnect support cloud servers that are part of a Cloud Network?" col="in" href="accordion1">}}

RackConnect support for Cloud Networks is available as of January 16,
2013.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="IMPORTANT: Can I attach/detach a Cloud Network on a running RackConnected Cloud Server?" col="in" href="accordion2">}}

Attaching/detaching a Cloud Network on a running RackConnected Cloud
Server reset the network stack, which breaks the cloud
server's RackConnect connectivity. Therefore, we don't recommend
attaching or detaching Cloud Networks to running RackConnect servers.
If you need to attach or detach a network, contact your
Support team before making the change.

{{<accordion title="What are the requirements for using Cloud Networks with RackConnect?" col="in" href="accordion3">}}

1. You must be a RackConnect 2.0 with Automation Features enabled customer.
 For further details on RackConnect Automation Features,
 please view the [RackConnect v2.0 Automation Features
 FAQ](/support/how-to/rackconnect-v20-automation-features-faq).

2. You must make sure to create cloud servers with the PublicNet and
 ServiceNet networks enabled, in addition to your Cloud Network.
 These PublicNet and ServiceNet networks are selected by default, and
 as a RackConnect customer, you cannot uncheck them in
 the [my.rackspace.com](https://my.rackspace.com) portal or the [Cloud
 Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/). But, if you are
 using the Cloud Servers API to create cloud servers, you can use API
 options to create cloud servers without the PublicNet
 or ServiceNet networks to avoid RackConnect failures.
 Be sure not to disable the PublicNet or ServiceNet
 networks when using the API to create new cloud servers.

3. Because RackConnect controls the software firewalls on your cloud
 servers through Network Policies, you also need to create a
 RackConnect Network Policy to allow communication between the cloud
 servers across the Cloud Network. Configure the Network Policy
 as follows:

 - Set **Access Scenario** to *Dedicated to Cloud Server(s)*.
 - Set **Source Server Network** to the network configured for your Cloud Network.

**Note:** You need to create this Network Policy, even if you already
have a `Cloud Server(s) to Cloud Server(s)` Network Policy allowing all
traffic.

{{<accordion title="What network ranges can I use with Cloud Networks for RackConnected cloud servers?" col="in" href="accordion4">}}

Cloud Networks itself normally supports any network range, but if you
plan to use the Cloud Network with RackConnected cloud servers, we
suggest you limit the network ranges you use to the following Private
Address Spaces:

- 10.x.x.x/8 **\***
- 172.16.x.x/12 -&gt; 172.31.x.x/12 **\***
- 192.168.x.x/16 **\***

**Note:** When you create Cloud Networks, adhere to the following guidelines to avoid connectivity issues:

   - Avoid using a network range that overlaps with 10.176.0.0/12
 or 10.208.0.0/12.
   - ****Avoid using** a network range that is already in use in your
 Dedicated environment.**
   - ****Avoid using Public IP address network ranges.****
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I use RackConnect and Cloud Networks to create one large Layer 2 Broadcast Domain that spans my Dedicated and Cloud environments?" col="in" href="accordion5">}}

In other words, can you have a single network, let's say **192.168.x.x/24**,
for your dedicated servers and also for your cloud servers so that they
can communicate as if they are all on the same network? Currently, the
answer is **no**. Your cloud servers connect to RackConnect through a
ServiceNet NIC and use a separate Cloud Networks NIC for Cloud
Networks connectivity. The ServiceNet Network and the Cloud Network are
two distinct networks that do not directly connect.
