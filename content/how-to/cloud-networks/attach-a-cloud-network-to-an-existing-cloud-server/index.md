When you create a new cloud server, you can attach an isolated network
to it. You can also attach an isolated network to an existing server by
using one of the following methods:

-   By using the [Cloud Networks API](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-networks/v2/developer-guide/)
-   By creating an image of the server and building a new server based
    on that image in the Cloud Control Panel

If you use the Cloud Networks API to attach network interfaces to or
detach them from a cloud server, you might experience a brief
interruption (lasting a few seconds) in traffic hitting your cloud
server while networking is being reset on the server.

+**Warning for Rackconnect v2.0:** Do not attach or detach a cloud network onto a server that is using Rackconnect v2.0. Attaching or detaching a cloud network on a Cloud Server using Rackconnect v2.0 causes the network stack to be reset, which breaks the cloud server's connectivity to Rackconnect v2.0. If you need to attach a network to a cloud server that currently runs Rackconnect v2.0, please contact support before making the change.

To attach an isolated network to an existing cloud server by cloning it
in the Cloud Control Panel, perform the following steps:

1.  Log in to the Cloud Control Panel.
2.  In the Cloud Servers list, click the server to which you want to
    attach the isolated network.
3.  On the **Server Details** page, scroll to the **Images** section.
4.  If you already have an image for this server, skip to **step 5**.

    To create an image for the server, in the details page of the server in the Images section, click **Create Image**, enter a name for the image, and then click **Create Image**.

    It may take a few minutes to create the image.

5.  In the **Images** section, click **View Images**.
6.  Next to the image you want to use, click the gear icon and then
    select **Create Server with Image**.
7.  On the **Create Server** page, enter a name for the new server. The
    image is preselected for you.
8.  Select a size (flavor) or the server.
9.  Expand the Advanced Options secion, and click **Select Networks**.
10. Select an existing isolated network in the popup dialog box, or
    click **Create Network** to create a new one. If you are creating a
    network, enter a network name, and then click **Create Network**.

    **Note**: All new servers are automatically attached to the PublicNet (the Internet) and ServiceNet (the Rackspace data center network) networks. If you are considering removing these networks from the server, we strongly recommend that you read [Removing Networks from a Cloud Server](/support/how-to/removing-networks-from-a-cloud-server) to fully understand the limitations that will be placed on this server if you remove these networks.

11. Click **Create Server**.

A new server is created with new public and private IP addresses and
attached to the networks that you selected.
