With Cloud Networks, you can create a virtual Layer 2 network that you
can attach to a new cloud server. This feature lets you keep your Cloud
Server separate from the Rackspace network, the Internet, or both.

### Cloud Network limitations

-   The Cloud Network must exist in the same region as the server.

-   You can create up to 10 isolated networks with up to 250 servers
    attached to each network.

-   You can't rename a network after you create it.

### Attach an isolated network to a cloud server

1.  In the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).
    The Cloud Servers page displays by default.

2.  Click **Create Server**.

3.  Enter a name for the server and select the region.

4.  Under Advanced Options, click **Select Networks**.

5.  Click **Create Network** to create a new isolated network.

6.  In the Create Network popup menu, enter a name for the network and
    click **Create Network**.

    **Note:** You can't rename a network after you create it.

7.  Select the network for your server and click **Select Network**.

8.  *(Optional)* Clear the check box next to a network in the Networks
    table to remove it from the server.

    **Warning:** Before you remove ServiceNet or PublicNet from your
    Cloud Server, read [Removing Networks from a Cloud
    Server](/support/how-to/removing-networks-from-a-cloud-server "Disabling Networks from a Cloud Server")
    for a complete description of the limitations that the system places on
    your new server.

9.  Click **Select Networks**.

10. Click **Create Server**.

Your new cloud server is created and attached to the new isolated
network. When the server build is complete, you can scroll down to see
the **Networks** table. The table displays each network the server is
attached to with the corresponding IP address. Following is an example
**Networks** table for a server that is attached to PublicNet (Internet),
ServiceNet (the Rackspace data center network), and an isolated Cloud
Network named **My Private Network**:
