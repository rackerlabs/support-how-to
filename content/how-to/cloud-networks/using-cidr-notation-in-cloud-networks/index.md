### What is CIDR?

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), is a range of IP addresses a network
uses. A CIDR address looks like a normal IP address except that
it ends with a slash followed by a number. The number after the slash
represents the number of addresses in the range.

Here's an example CIDR IP address in IPv4:

    192.0.2.0/24

Since IPv4 has a 32-bit address space the 24-bit prefix above means that
the address range is the 8 bits (256 addresses) after 192.0.2.0.

And here's an example in IPv6:

    2001:db8::/32

IPv6 has a 128-bit address range so the 32-bit network prefix means it
refers to 96 bits' worth of addresses following 2001:db8::, about 76
octillion addresses.

### CIDR Notation in the Cloud Control Panel

If you're using the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com)
to create a Cloud Network you won't need to worry about calculating the
IP address. The CIDR field is automatically populated with an IP block
on the Rackspace Network. You only need to supply a name for the network
and click **Create Network**.

For complete instructions on how to create a Cloud Network using the
Cloud Control Panel see [Create an Isolated Cloud Network and attach it
to a server](/support/how-to/create-an-isolated-cloud-network-and-attach-it-to-a-server "Create an Isolated Cloud Network and attach it to a server").

### CIDR Notation in the Cloud Networks API

If you're using the Cloud Networks API to create a network you must
specify the CIDR and a name for the new network.

The nova client command looks like this:

    nova network-create <network_label> <cidr>

Where network\_label is the name of the network, such as
my\_new\_network, and cidr is the IP block to allocate from, such as
172.16.0.0/24 or 2001:DB8::/64.

The following example shows a cURL command that creates the network:

    curl -s https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/010101/os-networksv2 <br>
             -X POST -H "X-Auth-Project-Id: 010101" -H "Content-Type: application/json" <br>
             -H "Accept: application/json" <br>
             -H "X-Auth-Token: 574c5763-86ab-431e-8b6c-5f7cf84c30ca" <br>
             -d '{"network": {"cidr": "192.168.0.0/24", "label": "superprivate"}}' | python -m json.tool

The JSON-format response would look similar to this:

    {
     "network": {
     "cidr": "192.168.0.0/24",
     "id": "aaa77608-bae2-4eed-840e-896a7dd345d4",
     "label": "superprivate"
     }
    }

**Note**: To help calculate a subnet, you might use a tool like this:
