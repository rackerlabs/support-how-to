### Introduction

Follow this quick-start guide to spin up a Brocade Vyatta vRouter
(formerly known as Vyatta network appliance). Keep in mind that the
username for logging into the appliance once the appliance is up and
running is "vyatta" and NOT "root." The minimum server size that you
will be able to choose is one with a 1GB RAM.

The configuration basics for this appliance can be found in Chapter 4 of
the [quick start guide](https://bit.ly/ZrdYHq).

### Launching the appliance

1. Click on the **Create Server** button. The Vyatta image should be
listed in the list of images. Look for an image called "Vyatta Network
OS 6.5R2" and select it.

2. Choose the server size (The minimum size for the server is
1GB).

3. If you have cloud networks enabled, you can create a new
network or choose from an existing network to attach to a server (This
is in addition to PublicNet and ServiceNet).  Do not disable PublicNet
or ServiceNet.

4. Click on **Create Server.** At this point you should see the
root-password for the appliance. Make note of this password.

**Note**: Keep in mind that you will be able to 'ssh' into the appliance
using a username "vyatta" and NOT "root."

5. Configure the appliance. The appliance can only be configured
via the command-line-interface. You must 'ssh' into the device on the
Public interface with username "vyatta" and the password from the
previous step (or anything you changed it to).

    $ ssh vyatta@X.X.X.X
    Welcome to Vyatta
    vyatta@x.x.x.x's password:
    Welcome to Vyatta
