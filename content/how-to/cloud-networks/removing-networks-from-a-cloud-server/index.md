Rackspace Cloud Networks lets you attach an isolated network to a Rackspace
Cloud Server. You can choose to attach or remove the
following networks to or from a Cloud Server:

-  **PublicNet**: Provides access to the Internet and Rackspace services such as Cloud
Monitoring, Managed Cloud Support, RackConnect, Cloud Backup, and
certain operating system updates.

-  **ServiceNet**: Provides access to Rackspace services such as Cloud Files, Cloud
Databases, Cloud Backup, and certain packages and patches through an
internal only, multi-tenant network connection within each Rackspace
data center.

-  **Isolated**: Provides a virtual Layer 2 network that keeps your server separate from
PublicNet, ServiceNet, or both.

### Limitations

You cannot remove PublicNet or ServiceNet from Cloud Servers with an
account on the **Managed Operations** service level. 

If you remove your Cloud Server from PublicNet, it no longer has access
to the Internet and some Rackspace products and services. If you remove
ServiceNet from your Cloud Server, it cannot access certain Rackspace
products and services. The following image depicts the services that are
not available when you remove these networks from a Cloud Server:
