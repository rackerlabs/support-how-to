This document is intended for Rackspace Private Cloud customers who want
to use the sosreport (SOS) tool to help troubleshoot their Rackspace Private
Cloud environment. In order to use the tool, you must have successfully
installed a cloud with Rackspace Private Cloud Software and be familiar with
OpenStack&reg;.

### The SOS tool

Rackspace Private Cloud Software installs the [sosreport tool for
Ubuntu&reg; operating systems](https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport), which you can use
to collect, analyze, and report information that helps you or Rackspace
Support troubleshoot issues in your Rackspace Private Cloud environment.
The `sosreport` package is installed from the [OS Ops team
personal package archive
(PPA)](https://launchpad.net/~osops-packaging/+archive/ppa).

### Generate a list of sosreport commands

You can display the complete list of sosreport options by using the command
`sosreport --help`, as shown in the following example:

    {.screen}
    $ sosreport --help
    Usage: sosreport [options]

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l, --list-plugins    list plugins and available plugin options
      -n NOPLUGINS, --skip-plugins=NOPLUGINS
                            skip these plugins
      -e ENABLEPLUGINS, --enable-plugins=ENABLEPLUGINS
                            enable these plugins
      -o ONLYPLUGINS, --only-plugins=ONLYPLUGINS
                            enable these plugins only
      -k PLUGOPTS           plugin options in plugname.option=value format (see
                            -l)
      -a, --alloptions      enable all options for loaded plugins
      -u UPLOAD, --upload=UPLOAD
                            upload the report to an ftp server
      --batch               do not ask any question (batch mode)
      --no-colors           do not use terminal colors for text
      -v, --verbose         increase verbosity
      --silent              Only display FATAL errors on stdout
      --debug               enabling debugging through python debugger
      --ticket-number=TICKETNUMBER
                            set ticket number
      --name=CUSTOMERNAME   define customer name
      --config-file=CONFIG_FILE
                            specify alternate configuration file
      --tmp-dir=TMP_DIR     specify alternate temporary directory
      --diagnose            enable diagnostics
      --analyze             enable analyzations
      --report              Enable html/xml reporting
      --profile             turn on profiling
      -z COMPRESSION_TYPE, --compression-type=COMPRESSION_TYPE
                            compression technology to use [auto, zip, gzip, bzip2,
                            xz] (default=auto)

### Use sosreport

Before you begin to use sosreport, log in to the node with the
username and password that you created during the installation process.
After you are successfully logged in, switch to root access by using the
`sudo -i` command.

#### Generate a report

To generate a basic report with the default settings, enter the following
command on the command line:

    {.screen}
    $ sosreport

You are prompted to confirm that you want to generate the report.
Press **Enter** to continue.

At the prompt, enter your first initial and last name. If you have been
assigned a case number by your Rackspace Support representative, enter
it at the prompt, as shown in the following example:

    {.screen}
    Please enter your first initial and last name [ctrl]: jdoe
    Please enter the case number that you are generating this report for: 1234

When the report is complete, the utility displays a message showing
you where the report `tar.xz {.filename}` file is saved and the
checksum for the report, as shown in the following example:


    {.screen}
    Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
      /tmp/sosreport-jdoe.1234-20120907125725.tar.xz

    The checksum is: acfcceaa72242483edece9e3b97687f1


You can now send the `.tar.xz {.filename}` file to Rackspace Support.

If required, you can run sosreport with additional reporting options.
For example, the `--diagnose` flag includes diagnostic options, and the
`--report` flag generates an HTML-formatted list of the files that were copied
in the report. Include additional options if requested by Rackspace Support.

#### sosreport plug-ins

Depending on the issue you're experiencing and the instructions that Rackspace
Support provides, you might need to disable or enable certain plug-ins when you
generate the report. To view a full list of available plug-ins, use the command
`sosreport -l`.

The output is similar to the following example:

    {.screen}
    root@ctrl:~# sosreport -l

    sosreport (version 2.3)

-   To collect all of the log files that are defined in the file
    `syslog.conf`, use the following command:

        {.screen}
        $ sosreport -k general.all_logs=on
