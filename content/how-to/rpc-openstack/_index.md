Rackspace has developed a set of tools that allow you to quickly install an OpenStack private cloud, configured as recommended by Rackspace OpenStack specialists.

Rackspace Private Cloud Software uses Ansible to create an OpenStack cluster on the Ubuntu operating system. The installation process provides a familiar approach for Linux system administrators, and the environment can be updated easily without downloading and installing a new ISO.

You can learn more about Rackspace Private Cloud and OpenStack [on the main product page](https://www.rackspace.com/openstack/private). You can also find Rackspace Private Cloud developer documentation on the [Rackspace Private Cloud Documentation page.](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/#docs-private-cloud)
