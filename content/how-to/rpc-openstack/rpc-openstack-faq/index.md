{{<accordion title="Where can I deploy Rackspace Private Cloud?" col="in" href="accordion5">}}

You can deploy a Rackspace Private Cloud in your own data center, in a Rackspace
data center, in a colocation facility or across multiple locations.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Is Rackspace Private Cloud updated with each new OpenStack version release (i.e. Mikata, Newton, Ocata)?" col="in" href="accordion6">}}

Yes, and we also have minor releases throughout the year to introduce new features, fix bugs and provide security patches.

The one exception is the Ocata release. Rackspace made a deliberate decision not to release an Rackspace Private Cloud version of Ocata for our customers because the short cycle between the Newton and Ocata releases had a low impact in terms of feature sets.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I install Rackspace Private Cloud on virtual machines?" col="in" href="accordion7">}}

Rackspace strongly recommends that you install Rackspace Private Cloud on
physical hardware nodes running Ubuntu 16.04 for the latest Newton release. Installation on virtual platforms should be performed only for evaluation purposes.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Does Rackspace Private Cloud come with any images?" col="in" href="accordion8">}}

Currently, Rackspace Private Cloud software does not include any images. Users can create their own images and populate those images into Glance image repository for on-demand consumption. For more information about downloading and creating images, see the [OpenStack Virtual Machine Image Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/).
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Why does the node IP address need to have Internet access?" col="in" href="accordion9">}}

Rackspace Private Cloud software downloads Ubuntu operating system installation files as part of
the installation process to ensure that you have the most up-to-date operating
system that works with our software. If the node doesn't have Internet access,
the installation process fails.
{{</accordion>}}
