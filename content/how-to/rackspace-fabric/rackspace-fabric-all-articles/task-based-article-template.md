Provide a descriptive title for the article that begins with an imperative verb in the metadata
above. For example: Restore a server from a snapshot.

Introduce the article by describing the task that the user wants to perform or the issue that the
user needs to solve. The primary audience for How-To content are Rackspace customers and Support
staff, who might have varying levels of technical expertise.

Write your article in Markdown. For more information about writing in Markdown, see the [Markdown
Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

For general writing guidelines, see the [contribution
guidelines](https://github.com/rackerlabs/rackspace-how-to/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Prerequisites (optional)

Include any prerequisites or required system setups. You can use bullets to describe a list of items:

- Required software
- Rackspace account
- Required CPU, networking, disk

### Limitations (optional)

Describe any limitations to the task described in this article. For example, the article applies
only to Linux systems, or has different requirements based on the environment.

### Procedure (repeat as necessary)

Provide a descriptive heading for this section that begins with an imperative verb. For example:
Create a new server.

List steps in numbered order and limit each step to a single action. You can add additional
information related to a step in an indented paragraph. For example:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).
2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.
3. At the top of the panel, select **Databases > MySQL Instance**.
4. In the **Identity** section, provide a name for the instance and specify the region in which you
   want to launch the HA instances that you create.

   The name that you specify and an index (such as -01, -02) are used to create all the instances
   names, starting with the master index.

5. Create more steps as needed.

   To display code in a block, indent code samples by four spaces in regular text and increase the
   indent as necessary in lists (as shown here).

Conclude with a brief description of the end state. You can create as many procedure sections as
needed to accomplish the task described in the introduction of the article. Be sure to use a
descriptive title for each section.

guidelines](http://rackerlabs.github.io/docs-rackspace/style-guide/screenshot-diagram-guidelines.html).

#### Procedure subtopic (repeat as necessary)

Any subtopics related to a procedure should use the next level heading. Follow the preceding
guidelines for subtopics.

### Troubleshooting (optional)

Include any troubleshooting information that pertains only to this task. If it might apply to more
than one article, create a new article for it and link to that article from here.

### Next steps (optional)

Include any links to articles that your audience should read next.

### Related articles (optional)

Include any links to related content. Use a bulleted list if you have more than one link. For
example:

- [Create an image from a server and restore a server from a saved image](/how-to/create-an-image-from-a-server-and-restore-a-server-from-a-saved-image)
- [About Cloud Server images](/how-to/about-cloud-server-images)
