Rackspace Email has added the ability to add links to files stored in
your Dropbox&reg; account in an email. Just click a button in the **Compose**
window to launch an external window to the Dropbox file selector. If you
have not authenticated to Dropbox, the system prompts to supply your
Dropbox credentials. Then you see your Dropbox files in the file
selector dialogue. You can select files to attach to the email and click
**Choose**. Links appear in the **Compose** window, and you can
send your email with links to your Dropbox files.

### How can you hide the Dropbox feature?

You can disable Dropbox integration in the following ways:

-   Disable Dropbox for an entire domain.
-   Disable Dropbox for all users of a private label Rackspace Email site.

#### Disable Dropbox for an entire domain

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).
2. Navigate to **Rackspace Email &gt; Webmail &gt; Show/Hide**.
3. Under **Dropbox**, select **turn off the toggle switch**.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Disable Dropbox for all users of a private label Webmail site

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).
2. Navigate to **Rackspace Email &gt; Webmail Sites &gt; Show/Hide Links**.
3. Under **Dropbox**, select **Disabled**.
4. Click **Save**

### You've used the feature before, but now it is asking you to log in to Dropbox. Why?

If you have a session established with Dropbox.com, you do not have to
log in or authorize Rackspace Email to access your Dropbox in any way. If
you do not have a session established with Dropbox, you must
re-authenticate and provide your credentials when prompted.

### Does Rackspace store my Dropbox credentials?

No. In fact, we never see or store your credentials. When you log in to
Dropbox, you send your credentials directly to Dropbox via a
secure connection.
