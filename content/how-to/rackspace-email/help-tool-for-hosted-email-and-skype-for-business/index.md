Rackspace provides a self-service help tool to assist  with the configuration of mobile devices, email clients, and Skype for Business.  You can log in to the help tool at [emailhelp.rackspace.com](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com/) with your Rackspace email address and password. The help tool provides step-by-step instructions for your specific server configuration.

**Note to administrators:** You can streamline the process of configuring a client or device for Exchange&reg; or Skype for Business&reg; by setting a DNS record for your domain that points to the Rackspace autodiscover server.  For more information about autodiscover, see [Set up DNS records for email and Skype for Business](support/how-to/set-up-dns-records-for-cloud-office-email-and-skype-for-business).

The help tool provides setup instructions for the following services on specific clients and devices:

- Hosted Rackspace Email with IMAP using SSL
- Hosted Exchange 2010 and 2013

If your domain is on Hosted Exchange 2007, the help tool does not provide setup instructions.
