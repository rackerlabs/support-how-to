Rackspace provides a self-service help tool to assist you and your users with setting up mobile devices, email clients, and Skype for Business.  You can log in to the help tool at [emailhelp.rackspace.com](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com/) with your Rackspace email address and password, and the help tool will provide step-by-step instructions that work with your specific server configuration.

**Note to administrators:** You can streamline the process of configuring a client or device for Exchange or Skype for Business by setting a DNS record for your domain that points to the Rackspace autodiscover server.  For more information about autodiscover, see [Set up DNS records for email and Skype for Business](/support/how-to/set-up-dns-records-for-cloud-office-email-and-skype-for-business).

The help tool provides setup instructions for the following services on specific clients and devices:

- Hosted Rackspace Email with IMAP using SSL
- Hosted Exchange 2010 and 2013
- Skype for Business

If your domain is on Hosted Exchange 2007, the help tool does not provide setup instructions.  You can find the username and server settings required by your email client in the Cloud Office Control Panel from the **Client Setup** tab or in the [User Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp).
