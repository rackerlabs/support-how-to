DomainKeys identified mail (DKIM) adds a secure signature to your domain to authenticate emails sent from users in your company. DKIM
is an industry best practice that increases the security of your email domains.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 15 minutes to create a record, 24-48 hours for the record to propagate
- **Tools required:**  DNS host administrator access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

Before enabling DKIM, we recommend you create a robust email verification policy by completing the following steps: 

1. [Create an **SPF** record policy](/support/how-to/create-an-spf-policy). 
2. Create a **DKIM** record. 
3. [Create a DMARC record policy](/support/how-to/create-a-dmarc-policy).

For a video tutorial of the following steps, see [Rackspace Email - DMARC / DKIM: What It Is & How to Setup](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com/l/dmarc-dkim-records-setup).

### Enable DKIM for a domain

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com)

2. In the **Domains** section of the home page, click the **Sender Authentication (DKIM)** link.

3. On the **Sender Authentication (DKIM)** page, click the domain for which you want to enable DKIM.  

4. Click **Enable DKIM for**.  

    - If you manage your domain's DNS through your Cloud Office Control Panel, DKIM enabling is automatic.

    - If you manage your domain's DNS through another service, that service provides the DNS key and value information to add a new
      TXT record. See the documentation of your DNS hosting provider for instructions on adding a new TXT record for your domain.
      If you do not know where your DNS is hosted, see [Find your DNS host](/support/how-to/find-dns-host).

5. After adding the DKIM TXT record, click **Verify TXT Record** to ensure that the new DKIM record is publicly available
   in DNS and is correct.  

   If validation fails, then an appropriate error message displays to help you correct the problem.

   After DKIM is enabled, all new outgoing email messages are signed using your new DKIM key. You can repeat the DKIM-enabling
   process on other supported domains.
