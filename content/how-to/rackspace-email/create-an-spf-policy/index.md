This article explains how to create an SPF policy to protect your email traffic.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 15 minutes to create record, 24-48 hours for the record to propagate
- **Tools required:**  DNS host administrator access

You also need access to update DNS entries for your domain. If you do not know where your DNS is hosted, see [Find your DNS host](/support/how-to/find-dns-host).

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

An SPF policy alone is not enough to protect the integrity of your domain's email. In order to create a secure email verification policy, we recommend the following:

1. Create an SPF record policy.
2. [Create a DKIM record](/support/how-to/enable-dkim-in-the-cloud-office-control-panel).
3. [Create a DMARC record policy](/support/how-to/create-a-dmarc-policy).

### Create an SPF record

1. Log in to the control panel for your domain DNS host.

2. Create a TXT record with the following specifications.

    | Type | Hostname | Destination | TTL |
    | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | TXT | @ | **v=spf1 include:emailsrvr.com ~all** | 3600 |

3. Decide how you want to enforce SPF failures.

    - `~all` will result in a soft fail (Not authorized, but not explicitly unauthorized).
    - `-all` will result in a hard fail (Unauthorized).
    - `?all` is neutral (As if there is no policy at all).

   Enter your choice after **v=spf1 include:emailsrvr.com**, and then save your changes.

4. Authorize additional mail servers by adding their IP or server name after **include:**.

    - For example:

    | Type | Hostname | Destination | TTL |
    | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | TXT| @ | **v=spf1 include:emailsrvr.com include:othermailer.com ~all** | 3600 |

5. Save your changes.
