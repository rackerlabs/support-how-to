This article describes how to synchronize IMAP folders after you set up a new
account in Apple Mail. Because Apple Mail does not automatically synchronize
IMAP folders, you must complete this process manually through folder mapping.

**Important:** If you have been using your IMAP account in Apple Mail and are
 having folder synchronization issues, contact support.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** 10 minutes
- **Tools required:**  Access to Apple Mail IMAP account

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see
[Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).

### Map IMAP folders in Sierra Apple Mail

 1. Within the **Mail** app, select **Mail** > **Preferences**.

 2. Select the **Accounts** tab at the top of the window, and then select your
    IMAP email account in the left pane.

 3. Select the **Mailbox Behaviors** tab.

 4. Click the **Sent Mailbox** menu, and select the **Sent** folder that is
    listed under your email (*not* the folder listed under **On My Mac**).

 5. Click the **Junk Mailbox** menu, and select the **Spam** folder that is
    listed under your email (*not* the folder listed under **On My Mac**).

 6. Click the **Trash Mailbox** menu, and select the **Trash** folder that is
    listed under your email (*not* the folder listed under **On My Mac**).

 7. Test the functionality of each of these folders to ensure that the mapping
    was successful.
