This article shows how to create an alias that forwards emails to another mailbox or to multiple mailboxes on a domain.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** 5 minutes
- **Tools required:** Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

Aliases are a way to create an alternate email address name for an existing email address. For example, John likes to go by Johnny and would like to receive emails to both John@domain.com (actual email address), for business partners, and Johnny@domain.com (alias email address), for friends and family, without checking two different accounts. In this case, he needs anything sent to johnny@domain.com to be delivered to john@domain.com.

### Add a single alias

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2. In the Rackspace Email section, click **Aliases**.

3. On the Aliases page, click **Add Alias**.

    **Note**: If you have multiple domains, select the appropriate domain name. To change domains, select the change domain link.

4. In the **Create New Alias** box, enter a name for this alias.
5. From the **Members inside this Domain** box, select one or more mailboxes and drag them into the **Current Members** box. They go into the **Members of this Alias** box.

    {{<image src="members_of_domain.png" alt="" title="">}}

    {{<image src="members_of_alias.png" alt="" title="">}}

    Note: The address that you want the mail to be delivered to must move to the right side under **Current Members** to receive mail sent to the alias address.

6. *(Optional)* Add up to four external addresses for domains like gmail.com, yahoo.com, or hotmail.com.
7. Click **Save**.

### Add multiple aliases

1. In the Rackspace Email section of the Cloud Office Control Panel, click **Aliases**.

    {{<image src="aliases_CP1.png" alt="" title="">}}

2. On the Aliases page, click **Add Multiple Aliases**.
3. Create a CSV or Excel file that contains the information detailed in the Data Format section of the Import Aliases page. You can download a template by clicking the **CSV template** or **Excel template** link.

    {{<image src="multiple_aliases.png" alt="" title="">}}

4. In the Import File section, click **Choose file**, select the CSV or Excel file that you created, and click **Open**.
5. On the Import Aliases page, click **Import**.
    
Any errors that occur are detailed in the **Import Summary**, which is displayed after the import is complete.
