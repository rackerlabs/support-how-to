You can enable or disable mobile phone collection in Webmail for a private label
site.

The system uses collected mobile phone numbers on account security
features such as forgotten password recovery and two-factor authentication.
Rasckspace does not disclose these numbers to third parties, including reseller
administrators.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).
2. Click **Rackspace Email**.
3. Expand **Webmail**.
4. Click **Show/Hide**.
5. Enable or disable **Password Reset**.
