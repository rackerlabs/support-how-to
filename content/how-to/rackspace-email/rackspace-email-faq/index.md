{{<accordion title="What's the difference between IMAP and POP?" col="in" href="accordion8">}}

The main difference between IMAP and POP is that IMAP works with email directly on the server, while POP
fetches mail from the server and works with it on your local computer. For more information, see
[IMAP and POP mail protocol comparison](/support/how-to/imap-and-pop-mail-protocol-comparison).

We strongly recommend using an IMAP connection with Rackspace Email.

{{<accordion title="How do TLS and SSL work in Cloud Office?" col="in" href="accordion15">}}

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Socket Layer
(SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide security for
communications over networks. TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of
network connections at the application layer to ensure secure end-to-end
transit at the transport layer. For our purposes, they create an
encrypted tunnel through which we send plain text emails.

Cloud Office servers, by default, attempt a TLS connection for both
in and outbound email. For outgoing mail (any of our servers sending to
external MX servers), we perform TLS if the remote server advertises it.
When performing outgoing TLS, our servers are permissive
with the certificate. In other words, if the site is using an untrusted
or self-signed certificate, as long as it is a working certificate, we
should still accept it.

**Our outgoing SMTP servers use TLS in an opportunistic fashion.**
This means that our servers attempt to open an SMTP transaction
with the recipient server by using TLS. If TLS cannot connect successfully,
the communication defaults back to an unencrypted
transmission of the data, also referred to as *PLAINTEXT*.

Our servers respond to TLS and SSL requests to send mail to us encrypted.
