### Catch-All addressing

Catch-All addressing is a mail-routing server feature that can be enabled and
linked to a live mailbox. The purpose of this feature is to catch-all email that
is sent to misspelled or nonexistent mailboxes on your domain.

The mailbox linked to the Catch-All server setting should be monitored regularly
by its administrator to identify misdirected or legitimate emails.

**Important**: Catch-All addresses are not filtered for spam. Use at your own
risk. With this feature enabled, you will receive thousands of spam email from
spammers who guess random addresses within your domain.

1. Click **Domains**.
2. Click on **Catch All Address** option.
3. Insert the email address you would like to use as catch-all address.
4. Click **Save**.
