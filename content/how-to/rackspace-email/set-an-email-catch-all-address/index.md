### Catch-All addressing

**Important**: This feature has been **sunset**. Refer to the [Rackspace Email to Open-Xchange Migration FAQ](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/rackspace-email-all-articles)

Catch-All addressing is a mail-routing server feature that you can enable and
link to a live mailbox. This feature aims to collect all email that
comes to misspelled or nonexistent mailboxes on your domain.

The administrator should monitor the mailbox linked to the Catch-All server setting regularly
to identify misdirected or legitimate emails.

**Important**: The system does not filter Catch-All addresses for spam. Use at your own
risk. With this feature enabled, you receive thousands of spam email from
spammers who guess random addresses within your domain.

1. Click **Domains**.
2. Click **Catch All Address**.
3. Insert the email address you would like to use as the Catch-All address.
4. Click **Save**.
