After you have renamed a Rackspace Email address, your email client will receive new mail only after you configure it to connect to the new email address. This article describes how to configure a renamed email address in Apple Mail.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:**  Mailbox password and access to the email client that you want to receive mail in

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).

**Warning:** If the old email address connects via POP, you must migrate the POP data to an IMAP account so that no data is lost.

### Configure mail settings

1. Launch the Mail app.

   If Mail is not in your dock, open search by pressing **Command (âŒ˜) + Space**, and then type **Mail** in the search bar. Press enter to launch the Mail application.

2. In the upper-left corner of the menu bar, select **Mail > Add Account**.

4. Enter the following information:

   - **Name:** Your first and last name
   - **Email Address:** Your renamed Rackspace Email address
   - **Password:** Your mailbox password

5. Click **Sign In**.

   An alert states that the mail client cannot verify your account name or password, and requires additional information.

6. Enter the following information:

   - **Email Address:** Your renamed Rackspace Email address
   - **User Name:** Your renamed Rackspace Email address
   - **Password:** Your mailbox password
   - **Account Type:** IMAP
   - **Incoming Mail Server:** secure.emailsrvr.com
   - **Outgoing Mail Server:** secure.emailsrvr.com

   **Note:** Apple Mail typically clears the **User Name** field after values are entered in the **Incoming Mail Server** and **Outgoing Mail Server** fields. Ensure that the **User Name** field is filled in with your email address *after* you enter the server information and *before* you click **Sign in**.

7. Click **Sign in**.
8. Select the appropriate synchronization options, and then click **Done**.

   **Note:** You can use the default settings.

**Warning:** You must configure your Mac to synchronize various IMAP folders and prevent duplicate folder creation. This is called **Folder Mapping**. For instructions, see [Sync IMAP folders for new accounts in Apple Mail](/support/how-to/synchronize-imap-folders-for-new-accounts-in-apple-mail/) for instructions.
