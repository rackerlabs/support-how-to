This article explains how to recover a Rackspace Email mailbox that was deleted within the last 14 days.

To recover a Rackspace Email mailbox, create a new mailbox by using the same username as the recently deleted mailbox. You'll be prompted with the option to restore the mailbox from the backup stored on our system.

**Note:** If you created an [email alias](/support/how-to/adding-an-alias-with-rackspace-email/) with the same username as the deleted mailbox, you must first delete the alias.

-   To create the mailbox without restoring any messages, click **No thanks, just create new mailbox**.
