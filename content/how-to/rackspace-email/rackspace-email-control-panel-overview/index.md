Welcome to Rackspace Cloud Office. After you sign up for Rackspace Email
services, you're ready to log in to your Cloud
Office Control Panel. This article provides a brief overview of the
Control Panel, which you can access at <https://cp.rackspace.com> (new
Cloud Office customers) or
[https://login.rackspace.com/](https://login.rackspace.com) (UK and
MyRackspace customers).

### Control Panel main page

After you log in to the Control Panel, you see a variety of sections
that showcase the products that you have signed up for&mdash;in this case,
Rackspace Email. Each product or service section has several options
and tools. The main landing page includes the **Rackspace Email** section, 
as well as the **Domains** and **News & Alerts** sections. As you sign up 
for additional products, each product has its own section so that you can 
manage it directly from the landing page.
