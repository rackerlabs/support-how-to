Welcome to Rackspace Cloud Office. After you sign up for Rackspace Email
services, the first thing you'll want to do is log in to your Cloud
Office Control Panel. This article provides a brief overview of the
control panel, which you can access at <https://cp.rackspace.com> (new
Cloud Office customers) or
[https://login.rackspace.com/](https://login.rackspace.com) (UK and
MyRackspace customers).

### Control panel main page

After you log in to the control panel, you see a variety of sections
that showcase the products that you have signed up for &mdash;in this case,
Rackspace Email. Each product or service section has several options
and tools. The main landing page includes the **Rackspace Email** section, 
as well as the **Domains** and **News & Alerts** sections. As you sign up 
for additional products, each product has its own section so that you can 
manage it directly from the landing page.
