You can rename an existing Rackspace Email address. This article provides an overview of the process, including information about backing up mail data, renaming the address, reconnecting to the address from your devices, and troubleshooting.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User or administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Dependent on the amount of data backed up, otherwise approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:**  Email address password and access to the devices you want to connect

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).


### Back up the mailbox

Before you rename your mailbox, export a copy of the mailbox from your [local mail client](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology). Creating a copy ensures that you won't lose any data when making configuration changes.

### Rename the email address

For instructions, see [Rename a Rackspace Email address](/support/how-to/rename-a-rackspace-email-address)

### Connect to the newly named address

After you have backed up the mail data locally, you are ready to connect to the renamed mailbox. Use the following instructions for your mail client.

#### Desktop clients

### Troubleshooting

#### I renamed my Rackspace Email address, but now Outlook and my phone are not receiving messages. How do I fix this?

Your devices are not receiving mail because they are configured to connect using the old email address. If you log in at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com) using the new email address, you can see that the mailbox is still receiving mail. Select your mail client in [Desktop clients](#desktop-clients) or [Mobile clients](#mobile-clients) for specific instructions.

#### I followed the configuration instructions and now I am missing mail! What happened?

In many cases this issue is easily resolved if you back up the local data before making changes. If you are missing mail data, it might be that your old configuration was storing data locally to your device. You can import the data into the new configuration.

#### Will mail sent to the old email address be delivered to my new email address?

Yes. When a mailbox is renamed, an alias of the old email address is automatically created to direct email to your new email address.

#### Did my password change now that I have a new email address?

No. Although we recommended changing your password regularly to keep your account secure, the rename process does not change the password.
