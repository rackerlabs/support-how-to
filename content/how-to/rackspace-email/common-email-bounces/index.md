This article explains the causes of common email bounce messages and how to resolve the underlying issue.

### Prerequisite

- **Applies to:** Administrators and Users

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

For a video tutorial see [Email Help - Bounce Messages](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com/l/common-bounce-message-solutions).

### Bounce messages

Bounce messages provide a brief explanation of why an email was not delivered. Bounce messages vary among mail providers. If you do not see your particular bounce message here, refer to the mail provider for an interpretation of their message.

- **4xx bounce** - A 400 error indicates a temporary failure, which means that a temporary condition has caused the email to not be delivered. The error can likely be resolved by sending the email again at a later time.

- **5xx bounce** - A 500 error indicates a permanent failure. This error does not mean you will never be able to send email again; you must change some aspect of either the message or the method of delivery for email to successfully be delivered. The bounce message should indicate what needs to change.

**Note:** If Rackspace bounced your email message, the generating server should show **emailsrvr.com** in the bounce message. If you do not see **emailsrvr.com** in the bounce message, the recipient’s provider might have blocked the message.
