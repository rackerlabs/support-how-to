This article shows how to create a group list.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** 5 minutes
- **Tools required:** Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

A group list is a great way to manage users in a select team or group on your domain. There is no limit to the number
of internal address recipients (addresses within your domain) and a limit of 250 additional recipients outside of the
internal domain. For example, suppose that you have a billing team you want to group together&mdash;bob@domain.com,
amy@domain.com, and scott@domain.com. You can create a group list for the team so that they can communicate new
upcoming billing updates within the team at **billingupdates@domain.com**.

**Note:** The maximum message size for group lists is 5 MB.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).

2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, click **Group Lists**.
