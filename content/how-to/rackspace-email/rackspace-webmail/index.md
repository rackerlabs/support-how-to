With Rackspace Email, you can check and manage your email online through a
[webmail](https://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/webmail) interface. Webmail
provides direct access to your email without the need for additional software.
Messages that are sent and received using webmail wait on the portal until the
next time you log in. The webmail portal provides most of the same
functionality that a mail client offers, including sending and receiving
email, signatures, and email forwarding.

This article provides an overview of the available features in the Rackspace
Email webmail interface.
