	 * **User Name:** Enter the name to use in the email address. For example, if you specify **myname** as the username, and the domain is **yourdomainexample.com**, then the email address is **myname@yourdomainexample.com**.
      **Note:** You are not able to create a username that already exists as an alias, group list, distribution list, or as another mailbox. You must remove the conflicting address from your account before using the same username for another purpose.

The mailbox appears in the mailboxes list. To manage additional features for the mailbox, such as forwarding, autoreply, aliases, or settings, click the mailbox name and then click the corresponding tab on the details page.
