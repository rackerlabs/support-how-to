You use the account section of the Cloud Office Control Panel to directly update and manage your account, including billing information, administrators, service usage, and cancellations. You access this section by clicking your account name in the top-right corner of the control panel and selecting the appropriate item from the menu.

### Company and billing details

When needed, you can change your company phone number, address, credit
card information, and administrators. You can also review your usage or cancel the entire account.

### Administrator management

You can add multiple administrators with varying degrees of account
access. There are Super, Standard, and Limited administrators. Limited
administrators have access to only specifically assigned sections of the
Control Panel. You can also monitor and export logs of all administrator
logins and actions.

For more information, see [Manage email administrators with the Cloud Office Control Panel](/support/how-to/manage-email-administrators-with-the-cloud-office-control-panel).
