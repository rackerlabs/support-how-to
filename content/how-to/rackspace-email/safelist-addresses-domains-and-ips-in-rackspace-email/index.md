This article explains how to add an email address, IP address, or domain to a
safelist in the Rackspace Email webmail interface to ensure important messages
are delivered to your inbox.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** 5 minutes

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see
[Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Why use a safelist?

**Safelisting** an address creates a rule that moves any message flagged as spam
from the address you safelisted to the **Inbox** so that you do not miss the
message. If you need to **Blocklist** a sender, see [Blocklist addresses, domains and IP addresses in Rackspace Email](/support/how-to/blocklist-addresses-domains-and-ip-addresses-in-rackspace-email).

**Warning:** Safelisting does not prevent a sender from being flagged as spam or being blocked.

### Safelist an email address or domain

1. Log in to your mailbox at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com).

2. Click your email address in the upper-right corner, and select **Settings** from the menu.
