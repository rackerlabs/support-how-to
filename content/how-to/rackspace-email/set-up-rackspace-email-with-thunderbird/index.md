your Thunderbird email client.

4. When prompted to create a new email address, click **Skip this and use my existing email** at the bottom of the dialog box.
5. In the Mail Account Setup dialog box, enter the following information in the fields provided:

    -   **Your name**: Enter the name that you want to appear in the
        **From** field of messages that you send.
    -   **Email address**: Enter your entire email address (for example,
        **yourName@example.com**).
    -   **Password**: Enter the password for the email account that you
        are setting up.

6. Click **Continue**.
7. When Thunderbird attempts to automatically detect the server settings, click **Manual config**. You must enter the settings manually.

   The dialog box expands to show new fields.

8.  Enter the following values in the **Incoming** row:
    -   IMAP
    -   **Server hostname**: secure.emailsrvr.com
    -   **Port**: 993
    -   **SSL**: SSL/TLS (This value should automatically populate when you enter
        the port number.)
    -   **Authentication**: Autodetect

8. Enter the following values in the **Outgoing** row:
    -   **Server hostname**: secure.emailsrvr.com
    -   **Port**: 465
    -   **SSL**: SSL/TLS (This value should automatically populate when you enter the port number.)
    -   **Authentication**: Autodetect

9. Click **Re-test**.

    The **Authentication** fields should change to **Normal Password**,
    and the following message should appear in the middle of the screen:

    `The following setting were found by probing the given server`.

10. Click **Done**.

    The setup process is done. Your mailbox should be added in Thunderbird, and mail should start populating the Inbox.
