This article shows you how to set up your Rackspace Email account by using
your Thunderbird&reg; email client.

1. Open Thunderbird.
2. From the welcome screen, click **Email**.

3. In the **Mail Account Setup** dialog box, enter the following information in the fields provided:

    -   **Your name**: Enter the name you want to appear in the
        **From** field of messages you send.
    -   **Email address**: Enter your entire email address (for example,
        **yourName@example.com**).
    -   **Password**: Enter the password for the email account you
        are setting up.
        
4. If Thunderbird can't set up your account automatically, the dialog box expands to show new fields.

5. Enter the following values in the Incoming column:   

    -   IMAP
    -   **Server hostname**: secure.emailsrvr.com
    -   **Port**: 993
    -   **SSL**: SSL/TLS (This value should automatically populate when you enter
        the port number.)
    -   **Authentication**: Autodetect

6. Enter the following values in the Outgoing column:

    -   **Server hostname**: secure.emailsrvr.com
    -   **Port**: 465
    -   **SSL**: SSL/TLS (This value should automatically populate when you enter the port number.)
    -   **Authentication**: Autodetect

7. Click **Re-test**.

The **Authentication** fields should change to **Normal Password**, and the following message should appear in the middle of the screen:

    `The following settings were found by probing the given server.`

8.  Click **Done**.

    
When the setup process completes, your mailbox should display in Thunderbird, and mail should start populating the Inbox.
