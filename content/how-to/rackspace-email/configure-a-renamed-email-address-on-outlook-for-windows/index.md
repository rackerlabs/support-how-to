After you have renamed a Rackspace Email address, your devices receive new email only after you configure them to connect to the new email address. This article describes how to configure a renamed email address on Outlook for Windows.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:**  Mailbox password and access to the devices you want to connect

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).

**Warning:** If the old email address connects via POP, you must migrate the POP data to an IMAP account so that no data is lost in the rename configuration. Follow the instructions in [Migrate from a POP server to Rackspace Email IMAP using Outlook](/support/how-to/migrating-from-a-pop-server-to-rackspace-email-imap-using-outlook/) before continuing with the instructions in this article.
