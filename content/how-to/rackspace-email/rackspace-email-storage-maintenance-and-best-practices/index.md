This article describes how to monitor user storage in the Cloud Office Control Panel as well as best practices for mailbox storage.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Moderate
- **Tools required:**  Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Check mailbox storage in the Cloud Office Control Panel

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f "Cloud Office Control Panel") using your Rackspace Cloud Office admin ID and password.
2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, click **Mailboxes**.
3. If you have multiple domains, select the domain for which you want to check storage.
4. The fourth column in the mailbox list labeled **Usage** shows the amount of free space each user has.

   The **Usage** column is not a real time reading of the mailbox storage. **Usage** updates once every 24 hours. Always reference the storage in [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php) for real time storage.

**Warning:** Never allow a mailbox to reach max capacity as any message sent to that mailbox while it is at max capacity will be rejected. Rejected messages will *not* deliver after more mailbox space is created. Messages sent *after* space is created will deliver normally. 

### Enable storage notifications

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f "Cloud Office Control Panel") using your Rackspace Cloud Office admin ID and password.
2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, click **Mailboxes**.
3. If you have multiple domains, select the domain for which you want to enable storage notifications.
3. Click **Settings** from the sub-ribbon under **Email Accounts**

4. Select **Storage Notification** from the options.
5. Check the box next to **Activate full mailbox notification** and adjust settings as desired.

    - Send a notification to the user when the mailbox reaches a certain percentage of capacity.
    - Send CC to an email address of your choosing so that you easily know when users are about to exceed capacity.
    - Customize the notification message to give your user instructions.  

6. Click **Save**.

### Check mailbox storage in webmail

1. Log in to [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php).
2. Click your username in the upper-right hand corner. The dropdown menu displays the current mailbox storage.

**Note:** Consider the storage shown in [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php) to be the authority for your storage available on the server.

### Recommendations for users nearing their storage capacity

Notify users near capacity and counsel them on archiving items to free up mailbox storage. Rackspace Email Archiving ensures that email traffic to and from your domain is archived. For more information, see [Enable email archiving: Cloud Office Control Panel](/support/how-to/enable-email-archiving-cloud-office-control-panel/).

Deleting emails frees up mailbox storage, however if a user deletes an excessive number of emails, it takes longer to process the deletion. Allow ample time for that deletion to be reflected in the mailbox storage capacity.

Email in the **Trash** folder *does* count toward mailbox storage capacity. Follow these steps to ensure a deleted message is not counting toward your mailbox storage:

1. Move an unwanted message to **Trash**.
2. Delete the message from the **Trash** folder.   

The message no longer counts toward the mailbox storage. If you need to recover a message that you deleted from trash, see [Recover deleted email in Webmail](/support/how-to/recover-deleted-email-in-webmail/).

**Warning:** Messages purged from the **Trash** folder can be recovered for up to 14 days after deletion. After 14 days, the message cannot be recovered.

### Mailbox storage best practices

- Enable [Rackspace Email Archiving](/support/how-to/enable-email-archiving-cloud-office-control-panel/) for all domains.    
- Rackspace Email storage is maxed at 25GB. Consider upgrading to [Microsoft Exchange](https://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/hosted-exchange) or [Office 365](https://www.rackspace.com/office-365) for higher storage limits.
- Never store over 10,000 items in one folder.
- You should not exceed more than 3 levels of subfolders.

   Example folder structure:

    - Best practice folder(level 1)

        - Best practice folder(level 2)

            - Best practice folder(level 3)

                - Not best practice folder

- Consider removing items from your **Spam** or **Trash** folders.
- If you archive or delete messages on your [local mail client](/support/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/#cloud-office-terminology), log in to [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php) to ensure that those changes are reflected in webmail.
