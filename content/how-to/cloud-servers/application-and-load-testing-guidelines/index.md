Part of offering a professional experience to your customers is knowing how your
applications perform and getting performance benchmarks for your
Rackspace-hosted assets. This article provides some helpful application, load,
and performance-benchmarking tests to help you get useful data. It also explains
your obligations when performing the tests and provides technical guidance for
performing the tests.

**Note:** When you perform any testing on or against Rackspace cloud servers,
you are operating under the terms of our
[Global Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/global/aup).

### Policing and enforcement

Rackspace monitors all cloud host servers for activities that reduce virtual
servers performance. If we find a virtual server affects another, we reserve the
right to hard reboot, suspend, or switch off the impacting server. We further
reserve the right to suspend or cancel the impacting account.

**Important**: When performing the recommended application tests, load tests,
and performance-benchmarking tests in this article, observe the following
guidelines before and during each test, and stop the test immediately if the
indicated thresholds are breached.

### Load testing

Be sure to continually monitor the effects of your tests as you apply load.
Before running load tests, ensure that you know how to view actual RAM, disk IO,
and network usage in real time. These metrics show whether a test risks
interfering with other customers' servers on the same host. For specific
thresholds, see the following Linux and Windows virtual servers sections.

Alternatively, there are load-testing services managed with external servers,
located globally. For example, [load testing with LoadView](https://www.loadview-testing.com)
allows you to use their external servers and offers testing of API load or
application load testing.

### Linux virtual servers

Install and use the `screen` package for your Linux distribution to run and view
the following commands at the same time. To compile the screen from source, go
to the [GNU homepage](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/).

#### RAM

Use the following command to view RAM usage as you perform tests:

     watch free -m

Don't let the value in the `Free` column in the `+/- buffers/cache` line go
lower than 1000.

#### Disk IO

Use the following command to view disk IO usage as you perform tests:

     top

Watch the `%wa` number in the second line. It might occasionally rise above 1.0,
but it should not be above 1.0 for more than a couple of seconds.

#### Network usage

Use the following command to view network usage as you perform tests:

     sudo watch -n 10 -d /sbin/ip addr show eth0

Watch the `RX bytes` number. Every 10 seconds, the `-d` argument highlights any
changes in this number. The 10-second pause gives you time to note the RX bytes
number before it changes. You can reduce the amount of math required to
calculate exact changes if you remember that at least eight digits must
change&mdash;per `watch -d` highlighting&mdash;between each 10-second update
before you need to apply any arithmetic. For virtual machines with 2 GB RAM or
more, at least nine digits must change before you need to calculate the exact
change.

The following table shows the maximum change in RX bytes per second by server
size before exact change should be calculated:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Cloud server size</th>
		<th>Maximum change in RX bytes per second</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>512 MB</td>
		<td>66,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1 GB</td>
		<td>99,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 GB</td>
		<td>198,000,000</td>
	</tr>
		<td>4 GB</td>
		<td>330,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8 GB</td>
		<td>495,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>15 GB</td>
		<td>660,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>30 GB</td>
		<td>990,000,000</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Windows virtual servers

To view and log the performance of a Windows server as you perform load tests,
you need to use the **Performance Monitor**.

Run the following command to start the monitor:

     perfmon.exe

This section describes some counters that you can use to ensure that you do not
exceed the thresholds and affect other customers on the server. You have to
change the scale of the graphs and also the counters in **Performance Monitor**,
especially regarding memory use. If you find these graphs hard to read and
track, we recommend that you use the `resmon.exe` utility to track them.

#### Processor use

Counter: **Processor Information > % Processor Time > _Total**

Purpose: Monitors CPU load as a percentage

Threshold: Don't let this counter exceed 90 percent.

#### Memory use

Watch the following memory-related counters during load testing:

- Counter: **Process > Working Set > _Total** (or per specific process)

  Purpose: Shows the current allocated or used RAM by the machine or specific
  application or process

  Threshold: Don't let this counter exceed 90 percent of the VM's total physical
  RAM.

- Counter: **Paging File > % Usage > Total**

  Purpose: Review this value in conjunction with **Available MBytes** to
  understand paging activity on your system.

  Threshold: Don't let this counter rise above 50 percent of the total paging
  size.

- Counter: **Memory > Available MBytes**

  Purpose: Shows free RAM available to be used by new processes, in megabytes

  Threshold: Don't let this counter fall below 10 percent of total physical RAM.

**Note:** If you are unsure of the amount of RAM installed, run the `msinfo32`
command from the **Run** box.

#### Disk use

Watch the following disk use counters during load testing:

- Counter: **PhysicalDisk > Disk Time > _Total**

  Purpose: Shows the amount of time that the disk is active

  Threshold: 90 percent

- Counter: **PhysicalDisk > Avg. Disk Queue Length > _Total**

  Purpose: Validates the communication medium

  Threshold: Don't let this counter rise above 4.

#### Network performance

Counter: **Network Interface > Bytes Total/sec > Network Interface**

Purpose: Measures the number of bytes sent or received

Threshold: Don't let link speed rise above the **Maximum PerfMon Link Speed
(%)** value for your VM's size, as shown in the following table:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Cloud server size</th>
		<th>Maximum PerfMon Link Speed (%)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>512 MB</td>
		<td>1.00%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1 GB</td>
		<td>1.50%</td>
	</tr>
		<td>2 GB</td>
		<td>3.00%</td>
	<tr>
		<td>4 GB</td>
		<td>5.00%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8 GB</td>
		<td>7.50%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>15 GB</td>
	    <td>10.00%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>30 GB</td>
		<td>15.00%</td>
	</tr>

### Network latency testing

Remote testing can cause network latency. To test the network latency to our
 data centers, ping them and then review the response times or the ping returns.
 Each Rackspace data center has its own sandbox server that you can use for ping
 and other network tests. Because most of our cloud infrastructure is hosted in
 the same data centers, this test also works for cloud servers.

Ping is publicly accessible for the following servers:

- sandbox.dfw1.rackspace.net
- sandbox.iad3.rackspace.net
- sandbox.lon3.rackspace.net
- sandbox.hkg1.rackspace.net
- sandbox.ord1.rackspace.net
- sandbox.syd2.rackspace.net

**Note:** To remove DNS lookup effects, you might want to determine each test
server's IP address and ping the IP address directly.
