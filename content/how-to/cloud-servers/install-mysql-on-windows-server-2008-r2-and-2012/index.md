This article provides instructions for installing MySQL on Windows Server
2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012 by using the Microsoft Web Platform
Installer (Web PI). Web PI makes it easy to install a variety of
applications to your server.

### Download Web PI

Download the most recent version of Web PI on your server from
[https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx).

### Install MySQL

1.  Launch the Web PI application by running the **wpilauncher.exe** file that
    you downloaded in the preceding section.
2.  In the Web Platform Installer window, search for **MySQL** in the
    search box.
3.  Select **MySQL Windows 5.1** (or current version), click **Add**, and then
    click **Install** to start the installation.

the installation directory. By default, this directory is set to **C:\\Program
