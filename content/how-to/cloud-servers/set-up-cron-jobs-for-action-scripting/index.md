This article describes how to set up directories and scripts to have cron run different actions
at regular times. 

This article uses the `pico` text editor, but you can use any text editor that you want, such as
`vi` or `nano`.

### Set up system scripts and directories

Use the following commands to set up the system scripts and directories for cron to run:

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/continuous.active

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/continuous.inactive

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/hourly.active

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/hourly.inactive

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/daily.active

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/daily.inactive

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/weekly.active

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/weekly.inactive
    
#### Set up script for continuous jobs

Run the following command to create the script file for continuous jobs and open it in a text editor:

    sudo pico /usr/local/sbin/continuous.sh

Insert the following script to run each container and all scripts held inside at the specified interval:

    #!/bin/bash

    ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/usr/local/sbin/continuous.active

    for module in `find "$ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type f`; do

        if [ -x $module ]; then

            $module

        fi

    done
    
Run the following command to make the **continuous.sh** script executable:

    sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/sbin/continuous.sh

#### Set up script for hourly jobs

Run the following command to create the script file for hourly jobs and open it in a text editor:

    sudo pico /usr/local/sbin/hourly.sh

Insert the following script to run each container and all scripts held inside hourly:

    #!/bin/bash

    ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/usr/local/sbin/hourly.active

    for module in `find "$ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type f`; do

        if [ -x $module ]; then

            $module

        fi

    done

Run the following command to make the **hourly.sh** script executable:

    sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/sbin/hourly.sh

#### Set up script for daily jobs

Run the following command to create the script file for daily jobs and open it in a text editor:

    sudo pico /usr/local/sbin/daily.sh

Insert the following script to run each container and all scripts held inside daily:

    #!/bin/bash

    ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/usr/local/sbin/daily.active

    for module in `find "$ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type f`; do

        if [ -x $module ]; then

            $module

        fi

    done

Run the following command to make the **daily.sh** script executable:

    sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/sbin/daily.sh

#### Set up script for weekly jobs

Run the following command to create the script file for weekly jobs and open it in a text editor:

    sudo pico /usr/local/sbin/weekly.sh

Insert the following script to run each container and all scripts held inside weekly:

    #!/bin/bash

    ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/usr/local/sbin/weekly.active

    for module in `find "$ACTIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type f`; do

       if [ -x $module ]; then

           $module

       fi

    done

Run the following command to make the **weekly.sh** script executable:

    sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/sbin/weekly.sh

### Add scripts to the crontab file

A crontab file contains a list of commands meant to be run at specified times. Use the following
command to edit the crontab file:

    sudo crontab -e

Each line in the crontab file has five date and time fields in the following format:

    minute (0-59) hour (0-23) day (1-31) month (1-12) weekday (0-6)

If you want to run a script some number of times per time unit, you can use the format `*/n`, where `n` is the number
of times that you want the script to run.

Add the following entries to the crontab file:

    MAILTO= youremail@domain.com

    */5 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/continuous.sh
    6 */1 * * * /usr/local/sbin/hourly.sh
    16 02 * * * /usr/local/sbin/daily.sh
    26 03 * * 0 /usr/local/sbin/weekly.sh
