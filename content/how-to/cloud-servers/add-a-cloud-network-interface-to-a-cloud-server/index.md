This article shows you how to use the Cloud Servers Application Program Interface (API) and the `rackspace-novaclient` (`nova`) to add a cloud network to a cloud server.  

Use the following steps to install `nova` and the Cloud Networks extension on Mac&reg; OS X&reg; and use `nova` to add a virtual interface to a running cloud server that connects to your cloud network. 

**Note:** `nova` is also available for Linux&reg; and Windows&reg;.

1. Run the following command on the command line:

       $ sudo easy_install pip
       
2. Install `nova` and the Cloud Networks virtual interface extension by running the following commands on the command line:

       $ sudo pip install rackspace-novaclient
       $ sudo pip install os_virtual_interfacesv2_python_novaclient_ext

3. Go to your local **.profile** file and set up the following environment variables in your local file by replacing the values inside the angle brackets `<>` with your account information:

       $ export OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/
       $ export OS_AUTH_SYSTEM=rackspace
       $ export OS_REGION_NAME=DFW
       $ export OS_USERNAME=<account_username>
       $ export OS_TENANT_NAME=<account_#>
       $ export NOVA_RAX_AUTH=1
       $ export OS_PASSWORD=<api_key>
       $ export OS_PROJECT_ID=<account_#>
       $ export OS_NO_CACHE=1

 4. Load the environment variables by running the following command:

        $ source .profile

5. Use your credentials to display your cloud server information. Note the ID of the cloud server to which you want to add the network.

       $ nova credentials

       $ nova list

6. Display the network information. Note the ID of your cloud network.
       
       $ nova network-list

7. Add the interface by running the following command on the command line (syntax: `nova virtual-interface-create <networkID> <cloudserverID>`):

       $ nova virtual-interface-create 30714e92-40d3-4259-bd73-2ed8b03abcf5 e74780b5-d180-4faa-bfc0-87802b20aaf4
       

The interface takes a few minutes to load. You can now log in to the cloud server and check interfaces by running the command `ip a`. You should see the added interface in the output from this command.

**Note**: You can also run `nova virtual-interface-list cloudserverID`.

If you need to add Cloud Networks to your account, submit a ticket from the **Control Panel**.
