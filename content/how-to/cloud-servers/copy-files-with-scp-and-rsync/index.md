This article describes how to transfer a file from and to a remote server.

### Copying files and directories with scp or rsync

You can use **SSH** or **rsync** to transfer files to a remote server. Secure Copy (scp) uses SSH to copy only the files or directories that you select. On first use, **rsync** copies all files and directories and then it only copies the files and directories that you have changed. **rsync** does not copy all the files and directories again.

##### SSH and scp examples:

* Copy a file **from** a remote server:
```sh
~$ scp user@IP.address:/path/file_name /local/destination/path/
```
* Copy a directory **from** a remote server:
```sh
~$ scp -r user@IP.address:/path/directory[/] /local/destination/path/
```

* Copy a file **to** a remote server:
```sh
~$ scp /local/path/file_name user@IP.address:/destination/path/
```
* Copy a directory **to** a remote server:
```sh
~$ scp  -r /local/path/directory[/]  user@IP.address:/destination/path/
```

##### rsync examples:

Because rsync transfers files recursively, you do not need to add the `-r` flag. You can use the following commands to transfer the files in an archived and compressed way:

	-a, --archive
	       Like recursion, this option preserves source characteristics (for example, permissions).
	-v, --verbose
	       This option shows you more information during the transfer.
	-z, --compress
	       With this option, RSYNC compresses the file data sent to the destination machine.

* Copy a file **from** a remote server:
```sh
	~$ rsync [-avz] user@IP.address:/path/file_name /local/destination/path/
```
* Copy a directory **from** a remote server:
```sh
	~$ rsync [-avz] user@IP.address:/path/directory[/] /local/destination/path/
```

* Copy a file **to** a remote server:
```sh
	~$ rsync [-avz] /local/path/file_name user@IP.address:/destination/path/
```
* Copy a directory **to** a remote server:
```sh
	~$ rsync [-avz] /local/path/directory[/]  user@IP.address:/destination/path/
```


**Note:**
A  trailing  slash ( / ) on the source changes the transfer behavior to avoid creating an additional directory level at the destination. With the slash, the directory content is copied without creating a new folder. Without the slash, a new directory is created with the source directoryÂ´s name. Following are examples without and with the slash:

            `
            ~$ rsync [-avz] /local/path/directory  user@IP.address:/destination/path/
            `
            `
            ~$ rsync [-avz] /local/path/directory/  user@IP.address:/destination/path/
            `
