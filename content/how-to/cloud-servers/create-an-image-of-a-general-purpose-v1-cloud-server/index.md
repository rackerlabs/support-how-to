This article walks you through creating an on-demand image of a General
Purpose v1 Cloud Server. You can also schedule a daily image for your
Cloud Servers using the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).
If you are interested in creating an image of a virtual Cloud Server, see
[Creating an image of your Performance Flavor Server with the Control Panel](/support/how-to/create-an-image-of-a-server-and-restore-a-server-from-a-saved-image).

**Note**: This is an optional service that incurs storage and bandwidth
charges on Cloud Files, but the convenience of easily restoring a
server from a saved image is extremely valuable. We strongly recommend
scheduling the creation of server images.

### Create an Image

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3.  Select **Servers > Cloud Servers**.

3.  Locate the server for which you want to create an image.

4.  Click the **Actions** gear icon to the left of the server name and
    select **Create Image**.

    A pop-up appears so you can name the image.

5.  (Optional) Enter a new image name in the pop-up for the image. If
    you don't enter a name, the server name is used as the image name.

6.  Click **Create Image**.

When the image is created, you'll receive a notification informing you
that the image is available. When the image is ready, the server's
status changes to **Running** and the status bar is green. You can use now
use this image to create a new server (using this image as a template)
or to restore the server.

### Locate a Saved Image

To locate a previously saved image, do the following:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3.  Select **Servers > Saved Images**.
