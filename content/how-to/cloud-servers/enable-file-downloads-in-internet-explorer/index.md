If you have created a cloud server on Microsoft Windows but are
having problems downloading files from your server, you might need to
enable file downloads in Internet Explorer.

Microsoft disabled file downloads by default in some versions of
Internet Explorer as part of its security policy. To allow file
downloads in Internet Explorer, follow these steps.

1.  Open Internet Explorer.
2.  From the **Tools** menu, select **Internet Options**.
3.  In the Internet Options dialog box, click the **Security** tab.
4.  Click **Custom Level**.
5.  In the Security Settings dialog box, scroll to the
    **Downloads** section.
6.  Under **File download**, select **Enable**, and then click **OK**.
7.  In the confirmation dialog box, click **Yes**.
8.  Click **OK > Apply > OK**.

Now you will be prompted for file downloads.
