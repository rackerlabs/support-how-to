If you have created a cloud server on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; but are
having problems downloading files from your server, you might need to
enable file downloads in Internet Explorer&reg;.

Microsoft disables file downloads by default in some versions of
Internet Explorer as part of its security policy. To allow file
downloads in Internet Explorer, follow these steps.

1.  Open **Internet Explorer**.
2.  From the **Tools** menu, select **Internet Options**.
3.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab.
4.  Click **Custom Level**.
5.  In the **Security Settings** dialog box, scroll to the
    **Downloads** section.
6.  Under **File download**, select **Enable**, and then click **OK**.
7.  In the **confirmation** dialog box, click **Yes**.
8.  Click **OK > Apply > OK**.

You can now download files.
