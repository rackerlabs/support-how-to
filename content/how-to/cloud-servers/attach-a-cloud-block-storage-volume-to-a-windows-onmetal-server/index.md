If you want more than 32 GB of storage but do not need
the fast I/O normally provided by an OnMetal server, you  can connect an
OnMetal server to a Cloud Block Storage volume. Using an OnMetal
server with Cloud Block Storage is particularly useful for OnMetal Compute
and Memory v1 flavors.

This article covers creating a Cloud Block Storage volume, attaching the
volume to a server, and connecting the volume in a Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;
server.

**Note**: Before you can delete an OnMetal server, you must detach the volume.
See [Detach and delete Cloud Block Storage volumes](/support/how-to/detach-and-delete-cloud-block-storage-volumes/) for instructions.

### Create a new Cloud Block Storage volume

If you don't already have a Cloud Block Storage volume, use the following procedure to create
a new a volume by using the Cloud Control Panel.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3. Select **Storage > Block Storage Volumes**.

4. Click **Create Volume** and fill in the fields.

5. Click **Create Volume** again.


### Attach an existing Cloud Block Storage volume to a server

Use the following procedure to attach a Cloud Block Storage volume to your
OnMetal server by using the Cloud Control Panel. The procedure assumes that
the server instance already exists.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3. Select **Storage > Block Storage Volumes**.

4. Click the cog beside the volume that you want to attach and select 
   **Attach Volume**.

5. Select a server from the list and click **Attach Volume**.

   **Note:** You can attach more than one volume to a server.

   A window opens with the following information:

       # set initiator name
       echo InitiatorName=iqn.2008-10.org.openstack: ae9f0492-d19d-45d3-9eac-6987b07f145a > /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
       # discover targets for a given portal
       iscsiadm -m discovery --type sendtargets --portal 10.190.142.197:3260
       # connect to the target
       iscsiadm -m node --targetname=iqn.2010-11.com.rackspace: ae9f0492-d19d-45d3-9eac-6987b07f145a --portal 10.190.142.197:3260 â€“login

   From this output, take note of the two `node` values that are needed to connect
   your Cloud Block Storage volume to your Windows OnMetal server: the `targetname`
   (`iqn`), which is the initiator and the target for your volume, and the `portal` IP
   address and port, which are your address. In the preceding example, these
   nodes have the following values:

   - `targetname=iqn.2010-11.com.rackspace: ae9f0492-d19d-45d3-9eac-6987b07f145a`
   - `portal 10.190.142.197:3260`


### Connect the volume in Windows

With the preceding information noted, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the Windows instance as a user with Administrator privileges, and
   open the Services Management console.

2. Select **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service** > **Properties**.

3. Set the service to start automatically, and then start the service.

4. Next, open the Administrator control panel by selecting **Start** ->
   **Control Panel** -> **Administrator Tools**.

5. Open the iSCSI initiator, click on the second tab, **Discovery**, and then
   click **Discover Portal**.

   A window opens where you can enter the Cloud Block Storage node address.

6. Enter the IP address (the `portal` IP address and port, which you noted
   earlier), and click **OK**.

   The target server appears in the list on the **Discovery** page.

7. Click the **Targets** page, and enter the target ICQ (the `targetname`, which
   you noted earlier).

8. In the **Target** field, enter the **target IQN** value (the `targetname` value, which
   you noted earlier), starting with `iqn`. Then click **Quick Connect**.

9. Open the Administrator control panel by selecting **Start** -> **Control Panel**
   -> **Administrator Tools**, and click **Computer Management**.

10. Select **Storage** -> **Disk Management** to see all of your drives.

    Because the Cloud Block Storage volume is attached, a second disk, the target, is
    listed and can then be prepared and brought online.
