All Cloud Servers automatically receive the following static Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses upon creation:

-   A version 4 **IP Address** that provides public access to your
    server from the Internet.
-   A version 6 **IP Address** that provides public access to your
    server from the Internet.
-   A ServiceNet IP address that you lets you access the server from
    other Cloud Servers or Cloud Load Balancers in the same region over
    the Rackspace data center network. Read more about
    [Regions](/support/how-to/about-regions).

To locate the IP addresses for your Cloud Server, execute the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).
2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.
3.  Select **Servers > Cloud Servers**.
4.  Click the name of server in the server list.
5.  Scroll down to the **Networks** section.
