This article describes how to configure a restricted Secure Shell (SSH) login to a server from a particular IP address or hostname.

To achieve this, use TCP Wrappers because they provide basic traffic filtering of incoming network traffic. Although more complex
on the surface, TCP Wrappers essentially use of two files: **/etc/hosts.allow** and **/etc/hosts.deny**.

If the files do not yet exist, you can created. them by using the following command:

    sudo touch /etc/hosts.{allow,deny}

### Deny all hosts

It is considered best practice to deny all incoming SSH connections. To do that, perform teh following steps:

1. Open file **/etc/hosts.deny** by using a text editor:

        vi /etc/hosts.deny

2. Add the following line to deny all incoming SSH connections to the server:

        sshd: ALL

3. Save and close the file.

Thatâ€™s it. This blocks all SSH access to the host

### Allow IP addresses

Now, perform the following steps to configure the IP addresses with authorization to log in by using SSH: 

1. Open the file **/etc/hosts.allow** file by using a text editor:

        vi /etc/hosts.allow

2. Add an `sshd` line to allow the IP address of your choice to connect by using public SSH. For example,
   the following line allows network ``172.168.0.21``:

        sshd: 172.168.0.21

3. Save and close the file.

The TCP Wrapper files accept a comma-separated list of entries, so you can append addresses to the first entry
in this section.

    sshd: 172.168.0.21, 10.83.33.77, 10.63.152.9, 10.12.100.11, 10.82.192.28

They also accept partial IP addresses as subnets, so you can allow the entire ``172.168.0.0/24`` as:

    sshd: 172.168.0.

Or as shown in the following example:

    sshd : localhost
    sshd : 192.168.0.
    sshd : 99.151.250.7

You can allow or deny based on IP address, subnet, or hostname. List rules in order of most to least specific.
Keep in mind that servers based on Linux&reg; operating systems look first at the **hosts.allow** file starting
from top to bottom, followed by the **hosts.deny** file. For example, an SSH connection attempt from an IP address
in **hosts.allow** is allowed, even though **hosts.deny** blocks all connections.

With this configuration, any client listed in the **hosts.allow** file are allowed through SSH and any client not
listed is blocked.

**Note**: The SSH daemon does not need to be restarted for changes to take effect.
