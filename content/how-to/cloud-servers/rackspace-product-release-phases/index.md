At Rackspace Technology, we have four release phases: Preview, Early Access Program, Limited
Availability, and Unlimited Availability. Here's a quick overview of the release
phases:

### Preview

We grant access to a small number of customers and partners and offer varied support
levels, no SLA, no pricing, often API only. The product is not production-ready.

### Early Access Program

We expand access to a larger number of customers. We offer varied support levels with no SLA
and might not have pricing finalized, often providing only API access. The product is not
production-ready.

### Limited Availability

This level is a production workload-ready product, although we limit the ramp and test it for cloud
scalability. This level includes 24x7x365 support, a full SLA, billing, and is production-ready.

### Unlimited Availability

We remove the waitlist and make the product available to all. This level includes 24x7x365 support,
a full SLA, billing, and it is production-ready.
