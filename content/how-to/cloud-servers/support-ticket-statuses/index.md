After you create a support ticket, it can have one of the following statuses, depending on the work done on it:

-   **In Progress**
-   **Pending Customer**
-   **Pending Rackspace**
-   **Solved**
-   **Closed**

The following process explains how a ticket moves through these
statuses:

1.  After the Rackspace Support team reviews a ticket, it moves to the **In Progress** status.

2.  If the Support team needs more information from the customer to fix the issue, the ticket might move to the **Pending Customer** status.

3.  If the ticket is waiting for an update or release from a vendor, the ticket might move to the **Pending Rackspace** status.

4.  If the ticket is waiting for a maintenance window and is not being actively worked, the ticket might move to the **Pending Rackspace** status.

5. When Rackspace resolves the issue, the status changes to **Solved**.

6.  After a ticket has a status of **Solved**, a customer can move the ticket to **Closed** or reopen it, which changes the status to **In Progress**.

7.  If a customer does not explicitly close or reopen a ticket with a **Solved** status, the ticket automatically goes to the **Closed** status after a set period of time, depending on the nature of the ticket's request.
