When you can't connect to a [Microsoft&reg; SQL
Server&reg;](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/database-services/microsoft-sql) instance remotely through ODBC, Visual Studio, or a SQL Server
Management Studio connection, usually the Windows firewall is blocking the access. Use the resolutions in this article to troubleshoot the issue.

### Open TCP ports

To troubleshoot this issue, open TCP port 1433 for the service itself. If you need to use the SQL Browser service, also open port 1434. This resolution applies to SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012.

1. Open the Run window, type **cliconfig**, and ensure that the TCP/IP protocol is enabled.

2. Verify that the SQL Server service is started.

   - *SQL Server 2005, 2008, and 2008 R2*: Select **Start > Administrative Tools > Services**, and verify that the **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** service is started.
   - *SQL Server 2012, 2014, and 2016*: Use the Windows key or hover the mouse pointer over the lower-left corner of the desktop, select **Administrative Tools > Services**, and verify that the **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** service is started.

3. Ensure that you are using the correct credentials to authenticate. The default SQL Server administrator account is named **sa**. If you built the server from a server image with SQL Server pre-installed, the password is in a text file on the root of the C partition.

4. From a command prompt, run **netstat -an**.

5. In the output, verify whether the server is listening for SQL Server traffic on the correct ports (1433 and optionally 1434). If it is not, proceed with the following steps to use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to change the ports.

6. Open the SQL Server Configuration Manager as follows:

   - *SQL Server 2005, 2008, and 2008 R2*: Go to **Start > All Programs > Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (or 2008 or 2008 R2) > Configuration Tools > SQL Server Configuration Manager**.

   - *SQL Server 2012, 2014, and 2016*: Use the Windows key or hover the mouse pointer over the lower-left corner of the desktop and select **All Programs > Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (or 2014 or 2016) > Configuration Tools > SQL Server Configuration Manager**.

7. In the navigation pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration** and select the protocols for your SQL Server instance.

8. In the right pane, right-click **TCP/IP** and select **Properties**.

9. Select the **IP Addresses** tab.

10. Ensure that all TCP ports mentioned on all interfaces is 1433.

11. Click **OK**.

12. Restart the SQL Server service.

### Specify the SQL Server instance name when using named instances

 Named instances give you the ability to host multiple SQL Server versions or service types. If you are using named instances when installing SQL Server, you must specify the name of the SQL Server instance when connecting rather than just using the server's name or IP address. Append the SQL Server instance name to the server's name or IP address, following a backslash. For example, *12.34.56.78\sqlInstanceName* or *sqlServerName\sqlInstanceName*.
