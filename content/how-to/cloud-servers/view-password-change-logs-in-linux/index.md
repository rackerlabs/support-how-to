Logs are a valuable asset when troubleshooting servers and checking for root
password changes. Password changes are logged in the following files:

For Ubuntu&reg;/Debian&reg; systems:

    /var/log/auth.log

For CentOS&reg;/RHEL&reg; systems:

    /var/log/secure

To check for root password changes, look for lines that mention either of the following messages:

    password changed for root
    Password for root was changed
