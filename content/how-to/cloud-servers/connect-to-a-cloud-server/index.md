To work with your cloud server you must establish a connection to it
from your local computer. How you make the connection depends on the
server's operating system and your desktop operating system.

### Connect to a Linux server

Use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to your Linux&reg; server. For connection
instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop operating
system:

-   [Connect to Linux from MacOS X by using
    Terminal](/support/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-mac-os-x-by-using-terminal)
-   [Connect to Linux from Windows by using
    PuTTY](/support/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-windows-by-using-putty)

### Connect to a Windows server

Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log in to your Windows&reg; server. For
connection instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop
operating system:

-   [Log in to your server via RDP
    (Windows)](/support/how-to/log-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)

### More information

If you can't connect to your cloud server remotely by using SSH or RDP, you can
access your server by using the [console in the Cloud Control
Panel](/support/how-to/start-a-console-session).
