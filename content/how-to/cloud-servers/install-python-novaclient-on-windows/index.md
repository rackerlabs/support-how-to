In this article, we'll discuss remotely managing a Rackspace Cloud Server using the
python-novaclient package running on Windows.

### Remote management

The [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com) isn't the only way to
manage Cloud Servers. If you're running a script or program, you can use the
[Cloud Servers API](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/v2/developer-guide/),
but that involves some coding effort.

If you want to manage your servers from the command line and not deal directly with the
API you can use an open-source client application called [python-novaclient](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-novaclient/).

**Note**: The nova client is not maintained by Rackspace and should be considered software
in development.

### Prerequisites

To run python-novaclient, you'll need python 2.6 or later installed on your system.  You can
run the client from either a desktop computer or from a remote system, like a Cloud Server.

The python installation needs to have the "setuptools" package installed as well. This
is installed with a python distribution like
[ActiveState ActivePython](https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads), which is
discussed in the next section.

To run the nova client, you need to have access to your Rackspace Cloud account username
and password.

### Install ActiveState ActivePython on Windows

If you don't have a python installation on your Windows system, download
and install the community (free) version of ActiveState ActivePython.

You can download the installer [here](https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads).

After downloading, run the installer.

#### Install the python-novaclient package

After ActiveState Python is installed, use the python package installer `pip` to
automatically download and install the nova client.

Open a command window by going to the Start Menu and typing "cmd" into the Search box. In
the command window, enter the following command to install the `pbr` package to work around a
bug:

    pip install pbr==0.5.21

Next, enter the following command to install a metapackage that includes the latest version
of python-novaclient and the Rackspace extensions:

    pip install rackspace-novaclient python-novaclient==3.3.0

The "rackspace-novaclient" is a metapackage that causes pip to install the client and all
Rackspace extensions for the client. If you have any problems with the metapackage,
use pip to install the "python-novaclient" and "rackspace-auth-openstack" packages
individually.

When the installations finish, close the command window.

### Install with other python distributions

If you're using another python distribution (like the official python distribution), you
can install the [python setuptools package from pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
(if it isn't included with the distribution), then use easy_install to install pip:

    easy_install pip

Then, follow the installation instructions in the preceding section.

### Environment variables

Now that the nova client is installed, set up the environment variables that
allow it to connect to your Rackspace Cloud account.

#### Find the environment variables editor

For most Windows versions, set your environment variables through the
**System** Control Panel.

1. From the Start menu, select **Control Panel**.
2. In the Control Panel, navigate to the **System and Security** section, and then select **System**.
3. In the System Properties window, click the **Advanced** tab in the top navigation.
4. In the Startup and Recovery section, click **Environment Variables**.

If you have any trouble finding the System Control Panel, type "environment"
into the **Start Menu's** search field. This action provides a link that lets you edit your environment
variables. If given a choice between editing values for your user account or the system,
choose the selection for your user account (unless you know other users on your machine will
need to be able to use the nova client).

#### Set the environment variables

Now set your environment variables. In the **User variables for Administrator** section,
click an environment variable and then click **New**.

Each variable set requires the following names and values.

          Cloud it should be <code>https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/</code>. </td>

          e.g. <code>DFW</code> or <code>ORD</code>. You can override the region setting
          with the <code>--os-region-name</code> command-line option.</td>
</tr>
</table>

After you've set all seven environment variables, "OK" your way back out of those
windows.  Note that any command windows you already have open will fail to reflect the
changes to your environment variables.

### Test the client

To make sure the nova client is ready to go, open a new command
window by going to the **Start Menu** and entering the following text in the search box.

    cmd

To see if you can talk to the API server, run the following command at the command prompt:

    nova image-list

If the command is successful, the system provides a list of the images available
to create a server.

### View the command list

To get a full list of commands, enter the following command:

    nova help

**Note**: You won't be able to use every command listed.  The nova client was
written for use with recent development versions of OpenStack, so it includes support for
some features that have not yet been implemented in the Rackspace Cloud.

You can get more help for a command by running the following command:

    nova help create

We'll talk about some of the more commonly-used commands in a later article.

### Troubleshooting

The client doesn't provide detailed errors.  A common problem is entering the username,
tenant name, or password incorrectly, so be sure to double-check those settings.

Remember that if you change any environment variables, you need to close your command
window and open a new one to work with the new values.

You can also use the options that are listed at the end of the "nova help" output to override
some environment variable settings.  If you're unsure about the region, for example, you can
substitute it with the `--os-region-name` option as follows:

    nova --os-region-name ORD image-list

### Next steps

By following the instructions in this article, you should have the nova client
set up so that you can access it and it can talk to your Rackspace Cloud account.
To look at some common operations you can perform with the client, like creating
servers and taking snapshots, see
