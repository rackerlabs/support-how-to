Customers can increase security on MyRackspace accounts by using the Rackspace
Cloud Identity Service multifactor authentication (MFA) capabilities. MFA
adds an extra layer of identity verification to the login process by requiring
a user to submit a time-sensitive code that the Identity service sends to an SMS
or mobile code device associated with the user's account:

- An SMS device is a mobile phone, notebook, or other digital device with an
  associated phone number capable of receiving SMS text messages.

- A client application installed on your phone, notebook, or other digital
  device creates and uses the mobile device code.

You can add MFA by updating your account settings in the
[MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com). After you pair a device with
your account, authentication becomes a two-step process:

1. Each time you log in, the Identity service generates a code and sends it
   to the paired device.

2. When it sends the code, the system prompts you to type the code and
   submit it to the Identity service to complete the authentication process.

   **Note:** Standard text message rates and data fees apply based on your
   contract with your mobile device provider.

Additionally, MyRackspace account administrators can configure account-wide
settings to specify an MFA policy for all account users. Administrators can
update the account-wide settings to require MFA for all users. When this setting
is enabled, users cannot access their account until they configure MFA. The system logs
current users out as soon as it applies the account-wide requirement. The next time
they log in, users get a notification of the increased security and a prompt to
complete the setup process.

**Important**: By default, we enable MFA account-wide. If you want to disable
this setting, you need to generate a support ticket.

### Considerations

- You cannot configure MFA from the Cloud Control Panel inside of the MyRackspace
  Portal. You must log in to the
  [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com) and use these
  [instructions](/support/how-to/multifactor-authentication-from-the-cloud-control-panel/)
  to set up your users for the Cloud Control Panel.

- Administrators cannot set up devices for users. Users must configure their own
  devices. To change MFA settings, users must log in to the MyRackspace Portal with
  the user credentials they want to modify.

### Configure your account to authenticate by using an SMS device

To configure your account to use an SMS device for MFA, you need the phone number
associated with your digital device. Ensure that you have enabled the device to
receive SMS text messages.

To register and verify an SMS device, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/).

2. In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the **user** menu
   and select **My Profile & Settings**.

3. In the **Security Settings** section, select **Enable** for **Multi-factor
   authentication**.

4. Select **User SMS** and click **Next**.

5. Select the country code for the device, type the device phone number and
   click **Next**

   **Note**: The Identity service sends an SMS text message with a four-digit
   PIN to the specified phone.

6. Type the PIN code sent to your mobile device in the verification code field
   then, click **Verify**.

   After you submit the verification code, you need to re-authenticate by using
   the MFA process.

### Configure your account to authenticate by using an OTP device

A one-time password (OTP), also known as a one-time PIN or dynamic password, is a
password that is valid for one login session or transaction on a computer system
or other digital device.

To configure your account to use a mobile code device for MFA, you must install
one of the following client applications on your device:

- [Authy](https://www.authy.com/)
- [Duo](https://www.duosecurity.com/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)
- [SecureAuth OTP](https://www.secureauth.com/Support/Downloads/Client-Applications.aspx)

To register and verify a mobile code device, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/).

2. In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the **user** menu and
    select **My Profile & Settings**.

3. In the **Security Settings** section, select **Enable** for **Multi-factor
    authentication**.

4. Select **Use a Mobile App** and click **Next**.

5. Type a **Device nickname** for the OTP device. Then, click **Next**.

6. The Identity service generates a QR code. Use the OTP client application on
    your device to scan the barcode and click **Verify**.

    After you scan the code, the OTP application on your device creates the OTP
    device using your specified device name. It also generates a code.

7. To verify the new device, enter the code on the **Verification Code** form.
    Then, click **Verify**.

    After you submit the verification code, the system automatically logs you
    out.

    **Note:** By default, the new OTP device is the default method for
    authentication. If you do not want it to be the default or if you do not
    want to be logged out of your account, remove the selection from **Make this
    my default authentication method**.

    You can update the default authentication method on the **Account settings**
    page.

8. In the Panel, enter your username and password. Then, enter the verification
    code from the OTP device that you paired with your account.

### Change the default MFA method

If you configured your account with both SMS and OTP devices, you can
select the default MFA method from the **My Profile & Settings** page.

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/).

2. In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the **user** menu
    and select **My Profile & Settings**.

3. In the **Security Settings** section, under **Multi-Factor Authentication**,
   select **Manage**.

4. In the **Security Settings** section, select **Enable** for **Multi-factor
    authentication**.

5. Under **Method**, select **Switch to SMS** if you set up a Mobile App or **Switch
   to Mobile App** if you set up SMS.

### Configure account-wide MFA settings from an Administrator account

Account administrators can update MyRackspace account-wide settings to require
all users to authenticate by using MFA. When this setting is enabled, users can't
access their accounts until they add and verify a device on their account.

To configure account-wide settings for MFA, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. Click **Account**, and then select **User Management** from the menu.

3. Click **My Multi-Factor Devices**.

4. Click the pencil icon to edit the **Require Multi-Factor** setting.

5. In the account-wide **multi-factor authentication** pop-up dialog box, select
   an option to set the policy for account users. Then, click **Save Setting**
   to apply the change.

   If you update the setting to be required, users who do not have MFA
   configured must add it the next time they log in.

   When these users log back in, the system guides them through the MFA setup.

### Configure MFA during account login

If you did not configure your account for MFA when required, the system
notifies you about the increase in security requirements and prompts you
to set up authentication.

To access your account, click **Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication.** Then,
follow the steps to register and verify a device and authenticate by using the
code sent to the device.

### Log in to MyRackspace by using MFA

If you add MFAn to your account, authentication is a two-step process.

#### Prerequisites

- MyRackspace account with a valid username and password credentials
- Access to the registered and verified SMS or mobile code device paired with
  your MyRackspace account

To log in to the MyRackspace Portal with MFA, use the
following steps:

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/) with your
   username and password.

   If you configured your account to use MFA with an SMS device, the Identity
   service sends an SMS text message with a 7-digit code to the device registered
   to your account.

   If you configured your device to use MFA with a mobile code device, open the
   client application and get the code from the mobile code device associated
   with your MyRackspace account.

2. When prompted, type the code in the **MFA Code** field on the login page.
   Then, click **Verify** to log in to your account.

### Manage MFA

MyRackspace users can view and manage the MFA configuration from the
**Account** > **User Management** > **My Multi-Factor Devices** menu in the
MyRackspace Portal.

#### To verify your device

You can verify your SMS or OTP device from the **My Multi-Factor Devices** page.

- If you have an unverified SMS device on your account, use the
  **Verify** option to complete the verification process.

- If you have an unverified mobile code device, use the
  **Manage** option to complete the verification process.

#### To recover an account

You can generate up to ten bypass codes that you can use to authenticate if the
device associated with your account is not available. You save the generated
codes to a file on your computer for future use.

**Important:** To avoid losing access to your account, generate and save the
bypass codes as soon as you enable MFA by using the following steps:

1. On the **My Multi-Factor Devices** page, click **Generate Recovery Codes**.

2. In the **Quantity** field, select the number of codes to generate or accept
   the default value.

3. Click **Generate Codes**.

4. Manually copy the recovery codes to a file or click **Save Your Codes** to
   generate a text file with the codes.

#### To remove MFA

You can turn off MFA and remove all devices associated with your account.

On the **My Multi-Factor Devices** page, click **Remove all devices**.

#### To change the mobile phone number

To change the mobile phone number paired with your account, use the **Remove all
devices** option to remove the existing phone number (for instructions, see the
preceding task). Then, update the authentication settings with the new phone
number and verify the device.

#### To remove an SMS or OTP device

To remove an SMS device, use the **Remove all devices** option. To remove an OTP
device, use the **Manage** option to delete the device from your account.
