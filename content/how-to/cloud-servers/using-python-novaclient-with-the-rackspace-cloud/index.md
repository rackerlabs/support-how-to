Python-novaclient is a command-line interface (cli) client for controlling
OpenStack cloud server instances.  Because Rackspace Cloud Servers are based on
OpenStack, the python-novaclient also works with that product. The cli client
provides a bit more functionality than the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com) without needing to delve
into the Application Programmer Interface (API) directly.

We have installation instructions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux:

You'll find a list of common operations that can be performed with the
client here:
