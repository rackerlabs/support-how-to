Plesk includes an email service that you can set up on a per-domain-name basis.
This allows customers to create email accounts for their domain names through
the Plesk web interface. The email service also includes a webmail feature, and
Courier or Dovecot provide IMAP and POP3.

### Prerequisites

- A dedicated server or virtual machine running Red Hat&reg; Enterprise Linux&reg; or CentOS&reg;
- Plesk Obsidian or later

### Procedure

Perform the following steps to modify your email service:

1. Log in to Plesk. See [Plesk: Introduction](/support/how-to/plesk-introduction) for these steps.
2. Navigate to **Domains** listed on the left-hand panel.
3. Select a domain.
4. Click **Mail Accounts**.
5. Select an account to modify.
6. This section allows you to adjust the user name, password, and mailbox size.
