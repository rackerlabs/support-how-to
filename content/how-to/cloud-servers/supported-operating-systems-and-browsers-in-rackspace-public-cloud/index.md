### Supported operating systems

Rackspace Public Cloud provides the following supported images.
On the same date that a distributor updates an operating system (OS), Rackspace updates services to support
the OS update. We continue to support earlier versions of the OS for a limited time after the OS update.

We do not support OSs marked as end-of-life (EOL) by its distributor.

We support current versions of the following OSs:

-   CentOS
-   CoreOS *
-   Debian®
-   Fedora® *
-   Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® (OnMetal Servers only)
-   Ubuntu® operating systems
-   Vyatta®
-   Windows® Server® 2008 R2
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2016 (OnMetal Servers only)

**Note:** Those operating systems with an asterisk (\*) to the right of the name are not supported at the Managed Operations service level.
