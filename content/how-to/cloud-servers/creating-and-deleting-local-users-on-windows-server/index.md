This article describes the process of adding and removing local users on Windows Server&reg; 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019.


### Access Local Users and Groups

1. Log in to the server from which you are removing the user.

2. To access **Local users and groups**:

    1. Click **Start > Run**.
    2. Enter **lusrmgr.msc** in the box and then click **OK**.
    3. Alternatively, you can use Windows search to search for **Local Users and Groups**.

3. In the console, double click on **Users**, and a list of users is displayed on the right.

### Adding a new user

1. Click **More Actions** and then select **New User**.

2. At a minimum, enter a username, a new password, and confirm that password. You should also enter the name under **Full Name** and a description of the account in the **Description** field.
    * To allow a user to set their password, ensure the box for **User must change password at next login** is checked. Otherwise, uncheck it.
    * To prevent the user from setting a new password, check the box labeled **User cannot change password**. Keep in mind, you cannot select this if **User must change password at next login** is checked.
    * If the user is being created but should not yet have login rights, check the box labeled **Account is disabled**. You can undo this at a later time if you wish.
    * Optionally, you can set the password to never expire by checking the box labeled **Password never expires**, although, you should rarely use this as aged passwords pose a security risk.

3. After you fill out the form, click **Create** to save the new user and then close the **New User** dialog. The newly created user now shows in the list of users.


## Removing an existing user

1. Right-click on the user that you wish to delete.

2. Click **Delete**.

3. There is a prompt warning that this cannot be undone. Click **Yes** to confirm.

**Warning:** If the user is associated with any services, those services might stop functioning after the user is deleted. You can disable a user instead of deleting it to avoid any issues.
