This article explains how to check if HTTP is being compressed on your Apache&reg; server. It also explains how to disable this compression. 

### Testing your server for HTTP compression 

1. Connect to the server using OpenSSL.

2. Add the following request to the header to check for HTTP compression:

       Accept-Encoding:compress,gzip

If compression is enabled, the server responds by compressing the page. If the server does not support compression, it  displays the page in plain text. 

### Disabling HTTP compression by using Ubuntu or Debian operating systems

To disable the compression by using Ubuntu&reg; or Debian&reg;, use the following steps:

1. Disable the module **mod_deflate** by using the following command:

       $ sudo a2dismod deflate

2. Restart the server:

       $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

### Disabling HTTP compression by using Red Hat or CentOS operating system

To disable the compression by using Red Hat&reg; or CentOS&reg;, use the following steps:

1. Access the main configuraton file:

       $ sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

2. Comment out the following line:

       LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so

3. Restart the server:

       $ sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart
