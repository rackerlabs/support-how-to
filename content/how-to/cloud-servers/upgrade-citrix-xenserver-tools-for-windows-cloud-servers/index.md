### Supported Operating Systems

- Windows Server 2008
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2

Citrix&reg; tools are fundamental to the proper operation of virtualized Cloud Servers
in the Rackspace Cloud infrastructure. They are the underlying drivers for the
virtual machine, giving it access to virtual hardware, specifically networking
and block devices.

This article explains how to upgrade the Citrix Tools for Virtual Machines on
Windows Cloud Servers. These tools should **only** be touched if the Windows
server is having issues such as Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), or if support has
recommended upgrading the tools.

**Warning:** Performing the steps in this article incurs network downtime.
Therefore, *do not* perform these steps on a production server, because this
causes network disruption and multiple reboots of the server. Instead, you
create an image of the production server on which to perform the upgrade.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, create a backup of your data from the server by using the
Cloud Backup. Create a Cloud Image of the server to retain its configuration.
The latest version of the Windows Agent is installed on the *production* server
before beginning this tutorial.

#### Create a Backup using Cloud Backup

Use the Cloud Backup product to back up all user data. This
[Cloud Backup instruction](/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-backup-create-a-backup/)
covers the installation of the Cloud Backup agent and the configuration of the
backup.

#### Create an image of the production server

1. [Create an image](/support/how-to/create-an-image-of-a-server-and-restore-a-server-from-a-saved-image/)
of the production server that needs the upgrades. This can take less than an
hour or multiple hours depending on the size of your server's virtual hard
drive. You can find more information about images on the
[Cloud Images FAQ](/support/how-to/cloud-images-faq/).

2. Create a new server by using the image that you created.

3. Verify that the new server boots properly and that all data and services are intact.

The new server that you created from the image is considered your *non-production*
server. The actions in all of the following sections should be performed on this
server.

#### Upgrade the Rackspace Cloud Servers agent and download the Xenserver Tools 6.5

The upgrade requires an active connection to the internet. Follow these steps
to install the Rackspace Cloud Servers agent.

1. Start a command prompt as an administrator.

2. In the command prompt, run the following code:

          powershell.exe -NoProfile -NoLogo -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://b2566e7bb4c60838ad8e-2feac036ecfab0eba46621f3ae4943bc.r28.cf1.rackcdn.com/latest/Update-Xentools.ps1')"

   Your output should be similar to the following:

          Info  :: STEP 1 => Update the Nova Agent
          Info  :: Starting the Agent Upgrade to version 1.3.1.1
          Warn  :: RackspaceCloudServersAgent RackspaceCloudServersAgentUpdater is stopped

          Info  :: STEP 3 => Before executing the installation of the Xenserver Tools,
                             YOU MUST CREATE A SNAPSHOT OF YOUR SERVER using the Control Panel
                             The Snapshot will allow you to recover your server if the installation fails.
                             Once you are done with This Step 3, Start the installation at STEP 4
                   ***************************************************************************************
          Warn  :: STEP 4 => Execute the Xenserver tools Installer.
                             Before you execute the installer, connect to the Console of the server
                             in the Control Panel, because the server will reboot few times on its own.
                             You will loose network access and Remote Desktop will fail
                             until the installation is completed.
                             *****************************************************************************
                             Execute:  C:\rs-pkgs\xs-tools-6.5.0-20200\install.bat
                             *****************************************************************************

### Upgrade to XenServer Tools 6.5 on the new non-production server

**Note:** The following steps **must** be performed via the console and not RDP,
as network connectivity will be interrupted. As an alternative to Java, there
are several ways to generate NoVNC (HTML5) console URLs.

Access the non-production server's Java console through the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3. Select **Servers > Cloud Servers**.

4. On the Servers page, click the gear icon next to the serverâ€™s name and then select **Emergency Console**.

To send API requests, use cURL from the command line, use the browser plugin of
your choice, or login to
[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.rax.io/servers/#get_vnc_console-cloud_servers)
with your Rackspace username and API key. Prior to sending the API call, be sure
to change the console_type to, "novnc". The response contains the URL to the
console. Copy and paste the link into a new browser tab. Note that these URLs
expire after about 10 minutes, and if the console is not in use, the session is
disconnected.

From the emergency console, run the following commands:

1. Start a command prompt as an administrator.

2. In the command prompt, run the following code:

        C:\rs-pkgs\xs-tools-6.5.0-20200\install.bat

3. The server automatically restarts several times, but may need to be manually
   rebooted if requested by Windows. Log back in using the console **after each reboot**
   and follow any Windows prompts. Allow Windows to automatically detect and
   install the needed drivers if requested by the driver software installation
   dialogue box.

4. After the installation is complete, there may be a final device which drivers
   can not be detected, or installed for in Windows Server 2008. This device is
   known as a `vm_gen_counter`, and is not supported in Windows until Server 2012.
    More information can be found in the following article about
    [VM-Generation ID](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831734.asp).

5. Ping the server's IP address from a remote location to confirm that the network is working.

6. If the server's network is not working, or the network configuration does not
   seem correct, it may be necessary to reset the network manually. This can be
   accomplished by sending the `resetnetwork` action to the servers API.

**Warning to RackConnect v2 Customers:** Manually resetting the network of a
server by using the API re-enables the server's public interface, and possibly
removes the default route to your RackConnect Gateway. We advise customers with
a RackConnect configuration to reach out to Rackspace support for help if having
network connectivity problems after an upgrade of the Citrix Tools.

#### Performing a Network Reset

To reset the server's network via the API, please login to
[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.rax.io/servers/#reset_network-cloud_servers) with
your Rackspace username and API key. Issue the, *Reset Network* call using the
server UUID.

To reset the server's network by hand, find the directory **C:\rs-pkgs\** where
separate text files exist that contain the IP configuration, and routing information
that was present before upgrading the Citrix Tools.

### Decide which server to keep

After performing the preceding steps on the new, non-production server, decide
whether to use the new server as your production server, or continue using the
original production server from which you made the new image. This section
explains your options.

#### Option 1: Use the new server as the production server

Now that the new server contains the updated Citrix Tools for Virtual Machines
and Rackspace Cloud Servers agent, it might be close to ready for production use.

You can delete the original server and continue using the new server as your
production server. This option is usually the quickest and easiest option.

One notable caveat to this option is that the IP address on the new sever is
different from the IP address of your original production server. The original
server's IP address cannot be transferred to the new server.  This issue can be
mitigated if Cloud Load Balancers has been in use with your original server. If
you were using load balancers, simply remove the original server (node) from the
load balancer, and then add the new one.

Before deleting the original server, ensure that *all important data* has been
properly restored to the new server. This includes any data that may reside on
an ephemeral disk drive that is not included in the image of the original server.
If you are not sure what an ephemeral drive is,
[the Rackspace Core Infrastructure User Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-config/compute/cloud-servers-product-concepts/diskconfig/).
If you are still uncertain, please contact Rackspace support for further guidance.

If the original server does have ephemeral storage, you can migrate the data to
the new server in a number of ways. If both servers have a service network IP
address, you can use the file sharing built into Windows. Alternatively, you
could use FTP, FTPS, or our Cloud Backup agent for cloud servers, which can be
installed on both Windows and Linux instances.

You can also transfer data between servers by adding Cloud Block Storage to the
original server. You create a volume and attach it to the original server, copy
the data that you need to the volume, detach the volume from the original server,
and then attach the volume to the new server where the ephemeral drive had been
mounted before, for example, **D:**. The following articles can help you get
started:

- [Overview of Cloud Block Storage](/support/how-to/cloud-block-storage-overview)
- [Prepare your Cloud Block Storage Volume](/support/how-to/prepare-your-cloud-block-storage-volume)
- [Cloud Block Storage FAQ](/support/how-to/cloud-block-storage-faq)

If you decide to use this option one, we recommend taking a final image of the
server which can be used as a base image to create new servers, or to rebuild
your current server.

#### Option 2: Perform installation steps on orginal production server

You can perform all of the installation steps on the production server during a
planned maintenance window. The server retains its original IP address.

After installing the Citrix Tools on the non-production server, you should have
a better understanding of how long your maintenance window should be.

Before you start this process a second time, on the production server, we
recommend that you have proper backups, preferably both an image of the server
and backups of all important content on the server. Although the previously built
new server should still be accessible and contain a nearly identical root file
system of the original server, multiple backups allow you to use the Cloud Backup
agent, which can be installed on both Windows and Linux cloud servers.

You can delete your new non-production server once the maintenance window has
been complete.

#### Option 3: Rebuild the original production from an image of the new server

You can rebuild the original production server from an image of the new server.
The server retains its original IP address.

Of all three options, this option takes the longest amount of time. The length
of time depends on how large your new non-production server's virtual hard drive is.

**Warning:** If you choose this option, we recommend that you create the proper
backups as outlined in Option 2. Rebuilding a server destroys all of the data on
the original server and installs the image that you select.

1. In the Cloud Control Panel, create an image of your new non-production server
and wait for the image to build.

2. In the Cloud Control Panel, navigate to the original server's detail page.
Underneath the server's **UUID**, click **Rebuild**.

3. In the pop-up dialog box that appears, click the **Saved** tab to view your
saved image and then select the image you created in step 1.

4. Click **Rebuild Server**.
