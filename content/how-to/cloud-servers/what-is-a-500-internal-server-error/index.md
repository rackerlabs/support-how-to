The generic error `500` means there is something wrong with the website server, but it doesn't provide
further information. An administrator should log into the server to troubleshoot and investigate the issue.

Several issues can cause this error, but most of the time, it means server-side problems such as the 
following issues:

- Permissions on website content files or folders.
- Issues with the **.htaccess** file.
- Scripting errors.
- Specific errors with the content management system (such as Wordpress&reg; or Magento&reg;).
