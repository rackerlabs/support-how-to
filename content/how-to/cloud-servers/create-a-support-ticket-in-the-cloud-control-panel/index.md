The best way to communicate with Rackspace support technicians is to create a
support ticket in the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).
This method enables you to copy and paste, or attach, cumbersome information,
such as traceroutes and error log entries, directly into the ticket.

### Create a new support ticket

You can create a support ticket by:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).
2. Select **TICKETS > Create Ticket**.
3. Select a broad product category, such as Cloud Servers or Cloud Databases.
4. Select a more specific category that narrows down the type of problem that
you are experiencing, such as General Support or API.
5. In the **Details** section, enter a subject and message that describes your
issue. You can also attach a file of up to 20 MB in size to the ticket.
6. After you have entered information into all of the fields, click **Submit Ticket**.

### View support tickets

To see previously opened or closed support tickets, click
**TICKETS > Ticket Lists**. A list displays your currently open tickets and a
tab with the option to view your closed tickets. Each ticket entry displays the
following information:

- name
- date last updated
- ticket status
- ticket ID number

To create a new ticket from the list view, click **Create Ticket**.
