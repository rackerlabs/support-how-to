This article describes how to list the Cloud Monitoring zones and source IP addresses with the Rackspace
Cloud API tool, Pitchfork.

### Log in to Pitchfork

Log in to Pitchfork at [https://pitchfork.rax.io/](https://pitchfork.rax.io/).

To learn how to log in to and use Pitchfork, refer to [Pitchfork&mdash;the Rackspace Cloud API web application](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/pitchfork-the-rackspace-cloud-api-web-application).

### List the Cloud Monitoring zones with Pitchfork

1. After you log in to Pitchfork, click on the **Cloud Monitoring** icon to pull up the Cloud Monitoring API calls.

2. Navigate to the **Zones** section to find the **List Monitoring Zone** API call. Then, click **Details** to expand the call.

3. Click **Send API Call**. The **Response Body** output of the API call displays the Cloud Monitoring zones and source IP addresses, as shown in the following example:
       
        {
            "source_ips": [
                "2001:4800:7902:0001::/64", 
                "50.56.142.128/26"
            ], 
            "id": "mzdfw", 
            "country_code": "US", 
            "label": "Dallas Fort Worth (DFW)"
        }


You can now perform the **List Monitoring Zone** API call.
