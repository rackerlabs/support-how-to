Customers can increase security on Rackspace Cloud accounts by using the
Rackspace Cloud Identity Service's multi-factor authentication capabilities.
Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of identity
verification to the login process by requiring a user to submit a
time-sensitive passcode that the Identity service sends to an SMS or OTP
(one-time password) device associated with the user's account:

-   an SMS device is a mobile phone, notebook, or other digital device
    with an associated phone number capable of receiving SMS
    text messages.

-   an OTP device is created in an OTP client application installed on
    your phone, notebook, or other digital device.

You can add multi-factor authentication by updating your account
settings in the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).
After you pair a device with your account, authentication becomes a two-step
process:

1.  Each time you log in, the Rackspace authentication service generates
    a passcode and sends it to the associated device.

2.  After the passcode is sent, the system prompts you to type the
    passcode and submit it to the Identity service to complete the
    authentication process.

    **Note:** Standard text message rates and data fees apply based on
    your contract with your mobile device provider.

Additionally, Rackspace Cloud account administrators can configure
account-wide settings to specify a multi-factor authentication policy
for all account users. By default, account users have the option to set
up and use multi-factor authentication. Administrators can update the
account-wide settings to require multi-factor authentication for all
users. When this setting is enabled, users cannot access their account
until they configure multi-factor authentication. Current users are
logged out as soon as the account-wide requirement is applied. At the
next login, users are notified of the increased security and prompted to
complete the setup process.

**Notes**

-   MyRackspace also implements multi-factor authentication, but it is
    not implemented through the Identity 2.0 API. For
    information, see [Multi-factor authentication from the MyRackspace portal](/support/how-to/multi-factor-authentication-from-the-myrackspace-portal).

-   When you enable multi-factor authentication for an account, it is
    enabled only for authentication via username and password
    credentials.

    If the user supplies the client with a valid username and API key
    credentials, the client receives the authentication
    token immediately. This behavior allows automated processes or
    agents to run operations by using the username and API key
    credentials.

-   Suppose you use an OpenStack or Rackspace CLI tool to authenticate with
    username and password. If you add multi-factor authentication to your account,
    you cannot authenticate because the CLI tools do
    not support multi-factor authentication.  To work around this
    problem, try one of the following approaches:

    -   Do not enable multi-factor authentication for accounts that
        require username and password authentication through a CLI tool.
    -   If you are using the nova-client, configure the client to
        authenticate with an API key.
    -   If you are using a client that supports token authentication,
        use cURL to get the authentication token. Export the token value
        to the token environment variable for the client--for example,
        OS_TOKEN or OS_AUTH_TOKEN. Then, use the CLI to submit API
        requests to the Rackspace Cloud.

-   You can also manage multi-factor authentication from the
[Identity API 2.0 Guide.](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-authentication-info/use-mfa-ops)

### Configure your account to authenticate by using an SMS device

To configure your account to use an SMS device for multi-factor
authentication, you need the phone number associated with your digital
device. The device must be enabled to receive SMS text messages.

To register and verify an SMS device, use the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the
    **Account** menu and select **Account Settings**.

3.  In the **Rackspace Account Settings** section, select **Enable** for
    **Multi-factor authentication**.

4.  On the **Register SMS Device** form, select the country code for the
    device and type the device phone number. Click **Add SMS Device.**

    After you click **Add SMS Device**, the Identity service sends an SMS
    text message with a four-digit PIN to the specified phone.

5.  On the **Verify Code** form in the Control Panel, type the PIN code sent
    to your mobile device in the verification code field. Then, click
    **Verify SMS Device**.

    After you submit the verification code, the Cloud Control Panel
    login page displays so that you can re-authenticate by using the
    multi-factor authentication process.

### Configure your account to authenticate by using an OTP device

A one-time password (OTP), also known as one-time PIN or dynamic password, is a
password that is valid for one login session or transaction on a computer
system or other digital device.

To configure your account to use an OTP device for multi-factor
authentication, you must have one of the following OTP client
applications installed on your device: [Authy](https://www.authy.com/),
[Duo](https://www.duosecurity.com/),
[Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en),
or [SecureAuth OTP](https://www.secureauth.com/Support/Downloads/Client-Applications.aspx).

To register and verify a mobile passcode device, use the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the
    **Account** menu and select **Account Settings**.

3.  In the **Rackspace Account Settings** section, select **Enable** for
    **Multi-factor authentication**.

4.  On the **Name of your Device** form, type a **Device nickname** for
    the OTP device. Then, click **Add Device.**

    After you click **Add Device**, the Identity service generates a
    barcode that you can use to link your Rackspace Cloud account with
    an OTP device.

5.  To pair your Rackspace Cloud account with your device, use the OTP
    client application on your device to scan the barcode on the **Verify Code** form.

    After you scan the code, the OTP application on your device creates
    the OTP device using the device name you specified. It also
    generates a passcode.

6.  To verify the new device, enter the passcode on the **Verify Code**
    form. Then, click **Verify Mobile Passcode**.

    After you submit the verification code, you are automatically logged out.

    **Note:** By default, the new OTP device is the default method for
    authentication. If you do not want it to be the default or if you do not
    want to be logged out of your account, remove the selection from
    **Make this my default authentication method**.

    You can update the default authentication method on the 
    **Account settings** page.

7.  In the Cloud Control Panel, enter your username and password. Then,
    enter the verification code from the OTP device that you paired with
    your account.

### Change default multi-factor authentication method

If your account has been configured with both SMS and OTP devices, you
can select the default multi-factor authentication method from the
**My Profile & Settings** page.

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the
    **userName** menu and select **My Profile & Settings**.

4.  In the **Security Settings** section, select **Enable** for
    **Multi-factor authentication**.

5.  In the **Security Settings** section, select **Enable** or **Disable** for **Multi-factor authentication**.

### Configure account-wide multi-factor authentication settings from an Administrator account

Account administrators can update Rackspace Cloud account-wide settings
to require all users to authenticate by using multi-factor
authentication. When this setting is enabled, users cannot access their
accounts until they add and verify a device on their account.

**To configure account-wide settings for multi-factor authentication**

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the
    **userName** menu and select **My Profile & Settings**.

4.  In the **Security Settings** section, select **Enable** for
    **Multi-factor authentication**.

5.  On the **Account-wide two-factor authentication** form, click the
    selection to set the policy for account users. Then, click **Save Setting** to apply the change.

    If you update the setting to `required`, users who do not have
    multi-factor authentication configured must add it the next time
    they log in. Current users who have not set up multi-factor
    authentication are logged out after seeing an error message similar to the
    following example:

    {{<image alt="Force user to log out when multi-factor authentication requirement is not met" src="mfa-force-logout.png" title="Force user to log out when multi-factor authentication requirement is not met">}}

    When these users log back in, they are guided through the
    multi-factor authentication set up.

### Configure multi-factor authentication during account log in

If your account is not configured for multi-factor authentication when
required, you are notified about the increase in security
requirements and prompted to set up authentication.

To access your account, click **Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication.**
Then, follow the steps to register and verify a
device and authenticate by using the passcode sent to the device.

### Log in to the Rackspace Cloud by using multi-factor authentication

If you add multi-factor authentication capabilities to your account,
authentication is a two-step process.

**Prerequisites**

-   Rackspace Cloud accounts with a valid username and password
    credentials
-   Access to the registered and verified SMS or OTP device paired with
    your Rackspace Cloud account

To log in to the Rackspace Cloud with multi-factor authentication

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com)
    with your user name and password.

    If your account is configured to use multi-factor authentication with
    an SMS device, the Identity service sends an SMS
    text message with a seven-digit passcode to the device registered to
    your account.

    If your device is configured to use multi-factor authentication by
    OTP device, open the OTP client application and get the passcode
    from the OTP device associated with your Rackspace Cloud account.

2.  When prompted, type the passcode in the **Passcode** field on the
    Control Panel. Then, click **Verify Code** to log in to your
    account:

    If the passcode is expired or invalid, refresh the page to return to
    the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel login page. Then, log in again and
    click the Resend code option on the Account Settings page to get a
    new passcode.
