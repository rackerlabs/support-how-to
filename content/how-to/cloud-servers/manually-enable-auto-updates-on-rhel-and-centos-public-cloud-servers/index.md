Keeping your servers up to date with security fixes can help you avoid server
compromises. While package updates can't prevent all security breaches,
keeping your servers up to date should be a key component of your security
procedures.

This article describes how to enable automatic updates on your Red Hat&reg;
Enterprise Linux&reg; (RHEL) and CentOS&reg; Rackspace public cloud servers to
ensure that crucial updates are installed and current.

### RHEL 6 and CentOS 6

Use the following steps to enable automatic updates on your
RHEL 6 and CentOS 6 Rackspace public cloud servers:

1. After connecting to your server, install `yum-cron` by running the following
   command:

       $ yum -y install yum-cron

2. To view the `yum-cron` configuration file, use the following command:

       $ vi /etc/sysconfig/yum-cron

   You can also open the file in any text editor.

   By default, the configuration is set to download and install the
   updates, as shown in the following example:

       # Pass any given parameter to yum, as run in all the scripts invoked
       # by this package.  Be aware that this is global, and yum is invoked in
       # several modes by these scripts for which your own parameter might not
       # be appropriate
       YUM_PARAMETER=

       # Don't install, just check (valid: yes|no)
       CHECK_ONLY=no

       # Check to see if you can reach the repos before updating (valid: yes|no)
       CHECK_FIRST=no

       # Don't install, just check and download (valid: yes|no)
       # Implies CHECK_ONLY=yes (gotta check first to see what to download)
       DOWNLOAD_ONLY=no

3. *(Optional)* To set up notifications for automatic package updates, such
   as time of installation, packages installed, and installation errors,
   edit the line beginning with `MAILTO=` to add an email
   address to receive notifications, as shown in the following example:

       # if MAILTO is set and the mail command is available, the mail command
       # is used to deliver yum output

       # by default MAILTO is unset, so crond mails the output by itself
       # example:  MAILTO=root
       MAILTO=example@example.com

4. Save the file.

   If you are using `vim` to edit the configuration file, press **esc** and
   then enter **:wq** to save any changes.

   After you have saved the file, the following message displays stating that
   the file was properly written:

       APT::Periodic::Update-Package_Lists "1";
       APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradable-Packages "1";
       APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
       APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "14";

5. Start the `yum-cron` service by running the following command:

       $ /etc/inid.d/yum-cron start

6. To start the service automatically on server reboot, run the following
   command:

       $ chkconfig yum-cron on

### RHEL 7 and CentOS 7

Use the following steps to enable automatic updates on your
RHEL 7 and CentOS 7 Rackspace public cloud servers:

1. After connecting to your RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 server, install `yum-cron` by
   running the following command:

       $ yum -y install yum-cron

2. To view the `yum-cron` configuration file, use the following command:

       $ vi /etc/sysconfig/yum-cron

   You can also open the file in any text editor.

   By default, updates are automatically downloaded, but not installed, as
   shown in the following example:

       # Whether a message should be emitted when updates are available,
       # were downloaded, or applied.
       update_messages = yes

       # Whether updates should be downloaded when they are available.
       download_updates = yes

       # Whether updates should be applied when they are available. Note
       # that download_updates must also be yes for the update to be applied.
       apply_updates = no

       # Maximum amount of time to randomly sleep, in minutes.  The program
       # will sleep for a random amount of time between 0 and random_sleep
       # minutes before running.  This is useful for e.g. staggering the
       # times that multiple systems will access update servers.  If
       # random_sleep is 0 or negative, the program will run immediately.
       # 6x60 = 360
       random_sleep = 360

3. For automatic updates to be downloaded and installed, ensure that
   `download_updates` and `apply_updates` are set to `yes`.

4. *(Optional)* You can set up notifications in the configuration file so that
   the output of the `yum` updates is emailed to you to inform you of what was
   completed and, if there are issues, what failed. Edit the following
   sections:

   1. In the `[emitters]` section of the configuration file, ensure that
      `emit_via` is set to `stdio`, as shown in the following example:

          [emitters]
          # Name to use for this system in messages that are emitted.  If
          # system_name is None, the hostname will be used.
          system_name = None

          # How to send messages.  Valid options are stdio and email.  If
          # emit_via includes stdio, messages will be sent to stdout; this is useful
          # to have cron send the messages.  If email_via includes email, this
          # program will send email itself according to the configured options.
          # If emit_via is None or left blank, no message will be sent.
          emit_via = stdio

    2. In the `[email]` section of the configuration file, edit the
       `email_to` field to add the email address to which you want the
       output to be sent, as shown in the following example:

           [email]
           # The address to send email messages from.
           # NOTE: 'localhost' will be replaced with the value of system_name.
           email_from = root@localhost

           # List of addresses to send messages to.
           email_to = example@example.com

           # Name of the host to connect to to send email messages.
           email_host = localhost

5. Save the file.

   If you are using `vim` to edit the configuration file, press **esc** and
   then enter **:wq** to save any changes.

   After you have saved the file, the following message displays stating that
   the file was properly written:

       "/etc/yum/yum-cron.conf" 81L, 2620C written

6. Check whether the `yum-cron` service is started by running the following
   command:

       $ systemctl status yum-cron

   If the service is not running (inactive), start it by running the following
   command:

       $ systemctl start yum-cron

7. Now that the service is running, you should ensure that the service starts
   automatically after a server reboot. Run the following command to check
   whether `yum-cron` is enabled:

       $ systemctl list-unit-files â€“type=service

   Find the `yum-cron.service` process in the list. If it is enabled, the
   service starts when the server is booted. If it is disabled, use the
   following command to enable it:

       $ systemctl enable yum-cron
