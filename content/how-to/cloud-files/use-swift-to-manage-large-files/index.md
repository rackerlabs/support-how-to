If you want to upload large files but don't want to incorporate our
code into an application, you might find it easier to use the [Swift&reg; tool](https://swiftstack.com/docs/integration/python-swiftclient.html) for
your uploads and management.

**Note:** If you prefer to use the API to manage large files, see [Use the API to manage large files](/support/how-to/use-the-api-to-manage-large-files),
and if you prefer Swiftly, see [Use Swiftly to upload an image](/support/how-to/use-swiftly-to-upload-an-image).

This article describes the upload process if you are using the tool.

The following command uploads **large_file** to **test_container** in 10
MB segments and then creates the manifest file so the system can download
the segments as one:

    swift upload test_container -S 10485760 large_file

You can change the size of the segments are by changing the value
following the `-S` option.

The following command downloads the large file as a single object:

    swift download test_container large_file

In the above example, Swift&reg; uploads all the segments into a second
container named **test_container_segments**. These segments will have
names using the format of
**<name>/<timestamp>/<size>/<segment>**. For example:

    large_file/1290206778.25/21474836480/00000000
    large_file/1290206778.25/21474836480/00000001


The main benefit for using a separate container is so the main container
isn't polluted with all the segment names. The naming format is so

that an upload of a new file with the same name won't overwrite the
contents of the first until the end when the process updates the manifest file.
