If you want to host a static website, a site where the content doesn't
change, you don't have to use a server. Instead, you can use the
Rackspace Technology Cloud Files service.

### Create a Cloud Files container to house your site

Use the following steps to create a Cloud Files container to house your site:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com/).

2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3.  Select **Storage > Files**.

4.  On the **Cloud Files/Containers** page, click **Create Container**.

5.  Type a name for your container and select the region where you want
    to host your site.

6.  Select the **Static Website** option and then click
    **Create Container**.

    **Note**: Selecting the **Static Website** option automates the
    following Cloud Files API operations:
    -   Sets the index page to **index.html** for both the container and
        any pseudo directories within the container.
    -   Sets your container to use CDN so that users can retrieve your
        content faster.

7.  On the page for your container, click **Upload Files**.

8.  Select the files that contain your website and click **Open**.

    **Note:** Ensure that you include all of your static website files
    in the upload and in their correct folders.

### Access your static website

Now your static website content exists in your Cloud Files
containers. However, to access your static website, you need the CDN
URL.

1.  In the Cloud Control Panel, go to the **Cloud Files/Containers** list.

2.  Click the gear icon next to the name of your container and select
    **View All Links**.

    **Note**: All of the CDN URLs for your container display. For HTML pages
    and pictures, use the **HTTP** link to access your static website. If
    you want to connect securely to your site, use the **HTTPS**
    link.

### Next Steps

If you want to make the URL of your static website more user-friendly,
you can set up a CNAME record with your Domain Name System (DNS) registrar.
To do so, you need to copy the **target (domain)** from your static
website container. To find your target, perform the following steps:

1.  In the **Cloud Files/Containers** list, click the gear icon next to
    your static website container and select **View Website Settings**.

2.  In the drop-down menu, copy the string in the **Target (Domain)**
    field.

3.  Go to your DNS registrar and point the CNAME to the domain that
    you copied. For instruction on how to complete this for the most
    popular DNS registrars, go to the following sites:

    - [CloudFlare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168706-How-do-I-do-CNAME-setup-)

You can also create your own CNAME by using the Rackspace DNS service. For
instructions, see [Create DNS Records for cloud servers with the Control Panel](/support/how-to/create-dns-records-for-cloud-servers-with-the-control-panel).
