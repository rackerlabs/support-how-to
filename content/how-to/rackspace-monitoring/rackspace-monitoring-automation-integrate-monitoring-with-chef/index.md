Do you leverage data center automation to build products faster? Do you want a
seamless way to define thresholds? Do you want to leverage some of the easiest,
most reliable technology to make monitoring a breeze? Learn how to leverage the
power of a full-featured and hosted monitoring system with Rackspace Monitoring!

### How?

- Leverage all the primitives built as a lightweight resource in Chef. This
     means you have complete control
- You're in total control - We run the monitoring system; however, it's a
    platform, and this code bootstraps the integration. It's up to you to define
    what you want to monitor and how you want to be alerted.
- We dogfood this internally - we'll continue to improve this as we continue
    to find new and interesting ways to use it.
- This is only the beginning - We'll continue to improve this cookbook as
    Rackspace Monitoring grows in functionality.

**What do I need to get started?**

- Chef knowledge.
- Ruby knowledge.
- Desire to reduce the time to monitor your infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

Getting started requires downloading the cookbook. Right now the Rackspace
Monitoring git repo is hosted on GitHub, but it will be an official cookbook
soon. Get the cookbook here:
[https://github.com/racker/cookbook-cloudmonitoring](https://github.com/racker/cookbook-cloudmonitoring).

Install it into a chef repo and then you're ready to get started.

*Note: If you are unfamiliar with chef I recommend reading the
[Opscode Getting Started Guide](https://docs.opscode.com/#getting-started). This particular
recipe uses data bags, read more about them here, that assumes a chef version
greater than 0.8.  Also, make sure and brush up on `knife` and how it works.*

### **Step 1: Create the initial encrypted data bag**

To manage the Rackspace Monitoring API, authentication credentials need to be
added to the node. There are various ways to handle this, this recipe uses the
encrypted data bag approach. Create the following data bag with the following
initial values:

    $ knife data bag create --secret-file <secret-file> rackspace cloud
    { "id": "cloud", "username": "", "apikey": "", "region": "" }

Once created this will make it painless to use the recipes without having to
include API key and Rackspace Cloud account username for every call. For
information about how to find your API key, see
[View and reset your API key](/support/how-to/view-and-reset-your-api-key).

### **Step 2: Add the default recipe to the runlist**

Next step is to add the cloud\_monitoring::default recipe to the run list for
the servers that will need monitoring. This identifies the servers that will
interact with the Rackspace Monitoring API. It will also install all the gem
dependencies needed to make calls with the Rackspace Monitoring Gem. Use the
`knife` command to add the default recipe to the runlist:

    $ knife node run_list add <NODE> cloud_monitoring::default

Chef's runlist inheritance will also serve the same purpose.  If for
instance the cloud\_monitoring::default recipe is applied to the
production environment, then all production nodes will inherit the
recipe.

### **Step 3: Configure the initial node setup**

The approach on this cookbook focuses on flexibility for the user to use it as
they please. These particular instructions will use the recipe in an opinionated
way. As an example, the label of the entity will be the hostname. This is a
recommendation on how to leverage this recipe, but not the only way. Creating an
"Entity" is the first step of actually using the API from Chef. The Entity maps
to the target of what you're monitoring.

Entity in most cases represents a server, loadbalancer or website. However,
there is some advanced flexibility but that is only used in rare cases. This
use-case will highlight populating your chef nodes in Rackspace Monitoring.
Learn more about all these concepts in the docs and specifically the Concepts
section of the developer guide:

    cloud_monitoring_entity "#{node.hostname}" do
      ip_addresses        'default' => node[:ipaddress]
      metadata            'environment' => 'dev', :more => 'meta data'
      action :create
    end

Woohoo, upon a chef run, an entity with that label is created, or if it
exists it will be updated.  Another important point, if the chef server ever
goes away, the label of the entity will be matched up with hostname (in this
case).

### **Step 4: Create the first check**

After creating an entity, this describes one or more checks for that target
entity. It prescribes how often to poll a website, or which piece of HTML to
perform a regular expression match against. The documentation goes into more
depth in the Concepts section. Ping is the first check created in this guide, it
is simple to configure and straight forward:

After performing a chef run, the Rackspace Monitoring API should begin pinging
the specified entity. Since this snippet is using the target\_alias feature, it
points at the IP specified node\[:ipaddress\]. If that ever changes the check
will automatically update. This is an important feature of the Rackspace
Monitoring API:

    cloud_monitoring_check  "ping" do
      target_alias          'default'
      type                  'remote.ping'
      period                30
      timeout               10
      monitoring_zones_poll ['mzord']
      action :create
    end

### **Step 5: Create an alarm**

An alarm describes how a user gets an alert based on a check.  It matches the
criteria to alert with a destination to send the notifications. The alarm
leverages our Javascript-like language to create criteria based on metrics for a
particular check. You can read in depth about the alarm language here:
<https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#alarm-language>.

We are going to create an Alarm for a ping either not returning (which would
happen by default) or is below 80% or 95% on the number of returned pings.By
default the remote.ping check sends out 5 pings and if 3 came back, it would be
marked as CRITICAL, if 4 came back it would be WARNING, if 5 came back it would
be marked as OK:

    cloud_monitoring_alarm  "ping alarm" do
      check_name            'ping'
      example_id            'remote.ping_packet_loss'
      notification_plan_id  'npTechnicalContactsEmail'
      action :create
    end

Three important events are happening in this example.

1. Since the entity recipe was placed before this stanza, it implicitly selects
   the `entityId` for this or any check in scope.

2. **npTechnicalContactsEmail** is a default notification plan that sends to the
   technical contacts on the account, if there is none it sends to the primary
   contact on the account. If there is no one on the account, it sends the
   Rackspace Monitoring team an email, which will in turn file a ticket.

3. This uses the alarm example API detailed here. This particular example uses
   the snippet below:

    ...
        {
            "id": "remote.ping_packet_loss",
            "label": "Ping packet loss",
            "description": "Alarm which returns WARNING if the packet loss is greater than 5% and CRITICAL if it's greater than 20%",
            "check_type": "remote.ping",
            "criteria": "if (metric['available'] < 80) {\n  return CRITICAL, \"Packet loss is greater than 20%\"\n}\n\nif (metric['available'] < 95) {\n  return WARNING, \"Packet loss is greater than 5%\"\n}\n\nreturn OK, \"Packet loss is normal\"\n",
            "fields": []
        }
    ...

### Done!

That's it. We now have monitoring for each server in your infrastructure with at
least ping checking. As you add servers Rackspace Monitoring will automatically
scale with you. As homework, work on adding more complex checks like SSH and
HTTP. We also support CPU, Disk and other host-based metrics.
