Rackspace Monitoring can be used with Rackspace servers and non-Rackspace
servers. When you are using a Rackspace server, you can be at a Managed
Operations service level or a Managed Infrastructure service level. There are
some differences between what you can do in each of these circumstances. This
article describes the following circumstances.

- Rackspace servers with a Managed Operations service level
- Rackspace servers with a Managed Infrastructure service level
- Unmanaged non-Rackspace servers

**Note:** Non-Rackspace servers are not managed.

### Rackspace servers with a Managed Operations service level

- Entities for Rackspace servers and databases are managed automatically, which
  means:
  - Monitoring entities are created automatically for new cloud servers or new
    cloud databases.
  - When a cloud server or cloud database is deleted, the associated entity is
    deleted in the monitoring system.
  - When the cloud server name is changed, the name is changed in monitoring
    automatically. (Instance names cannot be changed for cloud databases.)
- The label for Rackspace Cloud Servers can be changed only on the server
  directly. The change  propagates to the monitoring system quickly. The
  instance name for a cloud database cannot be changed.
- These servers have the default notification plan **npTechnicalContactsEmail**
  and have an additional notification entry, **npManaged**.
- The agent needs the agent token to authenticate with the monitoring server.
  This value is stored as **monitoring_token** in the agent configuration file.
  The agent is able to identify the server it is installed on to the server.
- By default, the monitoring agent is installed and turned on, and the
  monitoring is configured automatically. For details, see 
  [Managed accounts hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/dedicated-servers).
- For Cloud Databases customers, the monitoring agent is installed with monitoring configured
  automatically, by default. For details, see the
  [Cloud Databases documentation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-databases/v1/developer-guide/).
- You can access some monitoring features through the Cloud Control Panel and all the
  features through API. You can see more monitoring features, as well as metrics, through
  the [Rackspace Intelligence interface](https://intelligence.rackspace.com/).

### Rackspace servers with a Managed Infrastructure service level

- Entities for Rackspace servers and databases are managed automatically, which
  means:
  - Monitoring entities are created automatically for new cloud servers or new
    cloud databases.
  - When a cloud server or cloud database is deleted, the associated entity is
    deleted in the monitoring system.
  - When the cloud server name is changed, the name is changed in monitoring
    automatically. (You cannot change the instance name for a cloud database.)
- The label for Rackspace Cloud Servers can be changed only on the server
  directly. The change propagates to the monitoring system quickly. The instance
  name for a cloud database cannot be changed.
- These servers have the default notification plan **npTechnicalContactsEmail**
  only.
- The agent needs the agent token to authenticate with the monitoring server.
  This value is stored as **monitoring_token** in the agent configuration file.
  The agent is able to identify the server it is installed on to the server.
- By default, the monitoring agent must be manually installed. For details, see
  the
  [Rackspace Monitoring documentation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#install-and-configure-the-agent).
- For Cloud Databases customers, the monitoring agent is installed with
  monitoring configured automatically, by default. For details, see the
  [Cloud Databases documentation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-databases/v1/developer-guide/).
- You can access some monitoring features through the Cloud Control Panel and
  all the features through API. You can see more monitoring features, as well as
  metrics, through
  the [Rackspace Intelligence interface](https://intelligence.rackspace.com/).

### Unmanaged non-Rackspace servers

- Entities for non-Rackspace servers and databases must be managed manually,
  this means:
  - Monitoring entities need to be created manually for new servers. When
    configuring the default monitoring agent, you either select an entity you
    already created for it, or let the setup process create one for you.
  - When a server is deleted, you must delete the associated monitoring entity
    through the API or CLI.
  - When the server name is changed, you must manually change the name in
    monitoring.
- Monitoring entities can be deleted, and the label for servers can be changed.
- These servers have the default notification plan **npTechnicalContactsEmail**
  only.
- The agent needs the agent token to authenticate with the monitoring server.
  This value is stored as **monitoring_token** in the agent configuration file.

In addition, the agent needs to know the entity on which it is installed. This
value is the **agent_id** associated with the entity on the monitoring server.
This is also a field in the agent configuration file.

If you are going to create an image from a non-Rackspace server to be used to
create more servers, you need to remove the **agent_id field**, *before you
generate the image*, in the agent configuration file that is generated when you
run the agent setup. Otherwise, the agent will be associated with the entity
from which the image was created and the checks won't work properly.

Agent configuration files are located at the following paths:
- Ubuntu operating systems, CentOS: **/etc/rackspace-monitoring-agent.cfg**
- Windows: **c:\ProgramData\Rackspace
  Monitoring\config\rackspace-monitoring-agent.cfg**

To learn more about agent configuration, see
[Install and configure the Rackspace Monitoring Agent](/support/how-to/install-and-configure-the-rackspace-monitoring-agent).

- By default, the monitoring agent must be manually installed. For details, see
  the [Cloud Monitoring documentation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#install-and-configure-the-agent).
