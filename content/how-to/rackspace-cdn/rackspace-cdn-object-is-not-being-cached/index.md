When an object that is defined in the origin and located in the appropriate
path is not being cached by Akamai, you should contact Rackspace Support for
assistance. However the following information provides some insight into why this
situation might occur.

### Most common reason why cacheable objects are not cached on Akamai

The most common reason that cacheable objects are not cached is the presence of
a **Vary** header in the origin server response.

The **Vary** header informs Akamai servers that the content of the object might
differ based on some characteristic, such as the client's specified user-agent
or language, and is therefore not cacheable. This behavior is valid based on RFC
HTTP/1.1.

However, if the **Vary** header has a single value of **Vary: Accept-Encoding**
and the response is accompanied by **Content-Encoding: gzip**, then Akamai
caches the content. If the **Vary** header contains any values other than
**Accept-Encoding**, Akamai does not cache the object.

This restriction is necessary to prevent different versions of content from
being cached and then later served to end users for whom the content is not
intended. For example, this prevents pages in one language from being cached and
served to users of another language, or pages designed specifically for a
certain browser from being cached and then served to users on another browser.

An **Accept-Encoding** value to the **Vary** header is the exception to this
restriction only when it relates to serving the object compressed. Because
compression does not change the content of the object (only its size for
transfer), an object that varies only by its compression can be safely cached.

### Other common reasons why objects are not cached

In addition to the presence of a **Vary** header in the response, following are
the most prevalent reasons why objects that are specified to be cached are not
cached on an edge server:

- Another configuration setting overrides the cache setting
- Query strings are making your objects unique
- The request is a **POST** request
- The origin server returns a 302 redirect
- The origin server sends no-store **Cache-Control** and **Expires** headers and
  the configuration is setup to honor **Cache-Control** and **Expires**
  headers
- The origin server is sending an **Edge-Control** header specifying no-store.
- The **Content Length** header from the origin does not match the actual
  content length
- The **Date** header from the origin does not represent meaningful time because
  the origin clock is not synchronized
- The **Age** header from the origin is inconsistent
- Authentication or revalidation settings require all objects to check freshness
  with the origin every time
- The object is Edge Side Included (ESI)-processed or is a fragment from an ESI
  include
- The ETag is mismatched from the origin
- ESSL is used and even though a request goes to the same virtual IP (VIP)
  address, it resolves to a different physical IP address behind the VIP. As a
  result, it appears that the VIP doesn't have it in cache
