Use the following MySQL command to export your database.

    mysqldump -u root -p database_name > database_name.sql

database\_name is the name of your existing database. database\_name.sql
will be the name of the exported database file.

If your database resides on a remote host (as it would if you're using
Cloud Databases) you'll need to specify the hostname with the "-h"
option, as in:

    mysqldump -h host_name -u username -p database_name > database_name.sql

**Note**: Insert the username you created for username in this command.

It's also possible to set the "MYSQL\_HOST" environment variable to the
remote host's address so you don't have to enter it on the command line.

If you want to import this data to another database, see our article on
[Importing
Data.](/how-to/importing-data-into-cloud-databases)
