You can set the server time zone for a Cloud Databases instance so that
it is persistent by using the configuration groups feature of Cloud
Databases. You can use either the [Cloud Databases
API](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-databases/v1/developer-guide/#document-getting-started/manage-tz-ovw)
or the [trove command line
tool](/how-to/managing-configuration-groups-for-cloud-databases-with-the-trove-command-line-tool) to
make the configuration changes. The examples in this article use the
trove command line tool.

### Prerequisites

If you want to use the trove command line tool and you do not already
have it installed and set up, you need to do so. For instructions, see
[managing configuration groups using
trove](/how-to/managing-configuration-groups-for-cloud-databases-with-the-trove-command-line-tool).

### Setting the server time zone

The server time zone is set in MySQL in the `default_time_zone`
parameter and the default value is `SYSTEM`. To set `default_time_zone`
to a different value you can use the named time zone for the
region (from the [IANA Time Zone
Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones))
or the offset of the time zone from [UTC (Coordinated Universal
Time)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time). For
example,` the` name value for the Australian Eastern Standard Time
(AEST) time zone could be either `Australia/Sydney` for a region that
observes daylight saving time, or `Australia/Brisbane` for a region that
observes AEST year-round; because AEST is ahead of UTC by ten
hours, the offset value that can be used instead of the named time
zone would be `+10:00.`

You can set the `default_time_zone` parameter in a configuration group
that can be applied to your Cloud Databases instance. You can create a
new configuration group just for the time zone change or add the time
zone parameter to an existing configuration group.

### Create a new configuration group

To create a new configuration group for custom time zone information,
run the
[configuration-create](/how-to/managing-configuration-groups-for-cloud-databases-with-the-trove-command-line-tool#creategroup)
command with `trove`.

The following example creates a configuration group named TimeConfig
that sets the time zone to India Standard Time (IST), which
is Asia/Calcutta in the IANA time zone database.

To set up a configuration group using the named time zone, you can set
`Asia/Calcutta` as the value of `default_time_zone`, as in:

    trove configuration-create TimeConfig '{"default_time_zone":"Asia/Calcutta"}' --datastore MySQL

To create the configuration group using the offset of IST from UTC,
which is `+5:30`, use the offset value for `default_time_zone`:

    trove configuration-create TimeConfig '{"default_time_zone":"+5:30"}' --datastore MySQL

#### Apply the configuration group

To apply the configuration group to an existing Cloud Databases
instance, run the
[configuration-attach](/how-to/managing-configuration-groups-for-cloud-databases-with-the-trove-command-line-tool#applying)
command with `trove`, as follows:

    trove configuration-attach aab79bba-9eaa-4ac3-94fc-e4aaf46b4efb 26f6f753-3853-4bf5-9bfe-1765966ad2f6

The first argument is the instance ID and the second is the
configuration group ID.

You can get a list of instances and their IDs by running the list
command with `trove`.

    trove list

**Note:** For the time zone setting to take effect, the Cloud Databases
instance must be restarted.

#### Add to an existing configuration group

You can set the `default_time_zone` parameter can be set on an existing
configuration group by running the
[configuration-patch](/how-to/managing-configuration-groups-for-cloud-databases-with-the-trove-command-line-tool#modifying)
command with `trove`.

The following example adds the India Standard Time (IST) time zone to a
configuration group:

    trove configuration-patch 26f6f753-3853-4bf5-9bfe-1765966ad2f6 '{"default_time_zone":"Asia/Calcutta"}'

**Note:** For the time zone setting to take effect, the Cloud Databases
instance must be restarted.

### Checking the server time zone

You can check the current time zone setting for an instance by [logging
in to the mysql
console](/how-to/connect-to-a-cloud-databases-instance)
and querying the value of global.time\_zone parameter.

    SELECT @@global.time_zone;

The returned value shows the instance's current time zone setting.

    +--------------------+ | @@global.time_zone | +--------------------+ | +06:00             | +--------------------+

If the time zone does not reflect what you set in the configuration
group attached to the instance, the instance might need to be restarted
for the change to take effect.
