You can apply load balancing to anything with an Internet Protocol (IP)
address that's accessible on the Internet. This means that you can load
balance your Rackspace Cloud Servers, as well as any external server
or IP address. For example, you can load balance an external mail
server, database server, website, or your personal web server at
home. In load balancing terminology, the resources that you can load
balance are called *nodes*.

### Adding nodes

When you create a load balancer by using the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://login.rackspace.com), you see that Add Nodes is part of the
configuration process, as shown in the following image:

This is where you specify the things you want to load balance. You can
add an existing Rackspace Cloud Server or an External IP.

Note that the distance between the node being load balanced and the
region of the load balancer can impact performance of the load balancer.
We recommend creating the load balancer in the region that is closest to
your external nodes.

For more information, see [Load Balancing Internal IPs in the same region](/support/how-to/load-balancing-internal-ips-in-the-same-region).
