When you are finished using your server and are ready to delete it, you can
do this through the Cloud Control Panel. If you have already saved a
backup image of your server, you can use that image to create a new
server at a future time. That server is be an exact clone of your current server
at the time the backup image is saved, but it has a different IP
address.

**Note**: We recommend using Cloud Backup and Cloud Images before you
delete your cloud server instance to provide options for recovering your
server and its configuration at a later date.

### Delete a server

Use the following steps to delete a server:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation panel, click **Servers > Cloud Servers**.

3. Click the gear icon next to the server which you want to delete and select **Delete Server**.

Before the server and its data are deleted permanently, you are asked for confirmation.

To create a new server from the saved image of the server that you deleted, see the article [Create an image of a server and restore a server from a saved image](/how-to/create-an-image-of-a-server-and-restore-a-server-from-a-saved-image).
