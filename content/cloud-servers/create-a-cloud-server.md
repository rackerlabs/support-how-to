Use the following steps to set up a [cloud
server](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers) through the Cloud
Control Panel interface.

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) and click **Servers > Cloud Servers** in the top navigation bar.

    **Note:** On the Dashboard in the Cloud Control Panel, you can click **Server** in the **Quick Build** section to go directly to the **Create Server** page.

2.  Click **Create Server**.

3.  In the **Server Details** section, enter a name for your server in
    the **Server Name** field.

4.  From the Region list, select the region in which you want to create
    the server.

    For more information about regions and how to use them effectively, see [About regions](/how-to/about-regions).

5.  In the **Image** section, select the operating system that you want to
    use.

    For a complete list of available images, see the [Images section](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/features#images) of the Cloud Servers product page.

6.  In the **Flavor** section, choose the appropriate configuration for
    the server.

    For more information about flavors, see the [Cloud Core Infrastructure User Guide](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-config/compute/cloud-servers-product-concepts/flavor-class/#cloud-servers-flavor-class).

7.  *(Optional)* Assign a public key to the server by selecting an
    existing key under **Advanced Options**.

    To add a new public key, perform the following steps:

    1. Click **Add Public Key** beside the SSH Key drop-down list.
    2. Provide a Key Name for your new public key.
    3. Paste your public key into the **Public Key** field.

       **Note:** If you do not have a public key, click [How to get a public key](/how-to/connecting-to-a-server-using-ssh-on-linux-or-mac-os) and follow the instructions in that article. For more information on how to generate a public and private key pairs, see [Manage SSH Keypairs for Cloud Servers with python-novaclient](/how-to/manage-ssh-key-pairs-for-cloud-servers-with-python-novaclient).

    4. After you have your entered your Key Name and the Public Key, click **Add Public Key**.

    Then, confirm that your key is listed in the SSH Key list for your new
    server.

8. As needed, create a new network and select the PublicNet and
    ServiceNet options.

9. The **Recommended Installs** section displays a number of recommended options for automatic installation and configuration. Select the check box next to one or more options that you want.

10. Click **Create Server**.

Your server is built. After it is done being provisioned, your server displays the status **Running** and is now available for remote connection. Specific remote connection instructions for your server are
displayed in the side bar on the right of the Cloud Control Panel.
