**Previous section:** [Resize standard and general purpose servers](/how-to/resize-standard-and-general-purpose-servers/)

This article shows you how to use the Cloud Control Panel to resize up a
compute or memory server. Resizing a server changes the RAM and disk space
allocation.

**Note:** Compute and memory servers can only be resized up. They can’t be
resized down.

Use the following steps to resize up your servers:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Servers > Cloud Servers** to view a list
   of your existing servers.

3. Click the gear icon next to the server that you want to resize, and then
   click **Resize**.

   A pop-up window that lists your server size options displays.

4. Select a new server size, and then click **Resize Server**.

   **Note:** Each server size has a different hourly cost for uptime, and the
   new cost goes into effect when the server resize process completes. This
   could mean that you pay different rates for the same server within a single
   billing cycle.

   A notification displays prompting you to verify the changes that you made to
   your system resources and that there was no adverse impact to your server.

5. Verify that your server was resized correctly by remotely logging in to
   your server and verifying your system resources and filesystem integrity.

   **Note:** Verification is an important step because it is the last chance
   you have to revert to the original size and cancel any changes to your
   server.

   For a Linux server, you can Secure Shell (SSH) to either the public or
   private Internet Protocol (IP) address and run the commands `df -h` (hard
   disk usage) and `free -m` (available RAM memory) to verify the changes.

   For a Windows&reg; server, additional steps are required to use additional
   space after resizing up. For more information, see [Adding Disk Space After
   Resizing a Windows Server 2012 Cloud
   Server](/how-to/adding-disk-space-after-resizing-a-windows-server-2012-cloud-server).

6. After you have verified the system resources and checked your file systems,
   select **Confirm** to confirm the resize or **Revert** to revert to the
   original size.

   Confirming the resize changes the server status. The process is complete
   when the **Status** reads as **Active**, the **Current Action** is
   **None**, and the server has come back up from a reboot. Any web services
   that you had running might require you to log in and manually restart them.

   **Note**: Resizes are automatically confirmed after 24 hours. Therefore,
   you cannot revert a server after you have manually confirmed the resize or
   after 24 hours have passed.
