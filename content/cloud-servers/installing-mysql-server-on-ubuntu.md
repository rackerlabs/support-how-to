MySQL is an open-source relational database that is free and widely used. It is
a good choice if you know that you need a database but don't know much about
all the available options.

This article describes a basic installation of a MySQL database server on
Ubuntu Linux. You might need to install other packages to let applications use
MySQL, like extensions for PHP. Check your application documentation for
details.

 - Install MySQL
 - Allow remote access
 - Start the MySQL service
 - Set the root password
 - View users
 - User hosts
 - Anonymous users
 - Create a database
 - Add a database user
 - Grant database user permissions

### Install MySQL

1. Install the MySQL server by using the Ubuntu package manager:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server

   The installer installs MySQL and all dependencies.

2. After the installation process is complete, run the following command to
set up MySQL:

    /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

The secure installer goes through the process of setting up MySQL
including creating a root user password.  It will prompt you for some
security options, including removing remote access to the root user
and setting the root password.

### Allow remote access

If you have iptables enabled and want to connect to the MySQL database from
another machine you must open a port in your server's firewall (the default
port is 3306). You don't need to do this if the application that uses MySQL
is running on the same server.

If you do need to open a port, add the following rules in iptables to open port
3306:

    sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 3306 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

### Start the MySQL service

After the installation is complete, you can start the database service by
running the following command. If the service is already started, a message
informs you that the service is already running:

    sudo service mysql start

### Launch at reboot

To ensure that the database server launches after a reboot, run the following
command:

    sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d mysql defaults

### Start the mysql shell

There is more than one way to work with a MySQL server, but this article
focuses on the most basic and compatible approach, the `mysql` shell.

1. At the command prompt, run the following command to launch the the `mysql`
   shell and enter it as the root user:

    /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p

2. When you're prompted for a password, enter the one you set at
   install time or, if you haven't set one, press **Enter** to submit no
   password.

   The following `mysql` shell prompt should appear:

    mysql>

### Set the root password

If you logged in by entering a blank password, or you want to change the root
password that you set, you can create or change the password.

1. Enter the following command in the `mysql` shell, replace `password` with
   your new password:

    UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = PASSWORD('password') WHERE User = 'root';

2. To make the change take effect, reload the stored user information, as
   follows:

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   **Note**: that we're using all-caps for SQL commands. If you type those
   commands in lowercase they'll work too. By convention the commands are
   written in all-caps to make them stand out from field names and other
   data that's being manipulated.

### View users

MySQL stores the user information in its own database. The name of the database
is **mysql**. Inside that database the user information is in a table, a
dataset, named **user**. If you want to see what users are set up in the MySQL
user table, run the following command:

    SELECT User, Host, Password FROM mysql.user;

The following list describes the parts of that command:

 - **SELECT** tells MySQL that you are asking for data.

 - **User**, **Host**, **Password** tells MySQL what fields you want it to
   look in. Fields are categories for the data in a table. In this case you
   are looking for the username, the host associated with the username, and
   the encrypted password entry.

 - **FROM mysql.user** " tells MySQL to get the data from the **mysql**
   database and the **user** table.

- (a semicolon) ends the command.

**Note**: All SQL queries end in a semicolon. MySQL does not process a query
until you type a semicolon.

#### User hosts

Following is example output for the preceding query:

    SELECT User, Host, Password FROM mysql.user;
    +------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
    | User             | Host      | Password                                 |
    +------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
    | root             | localhost | 2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19 |
    | root             | demohost  | 2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19 |
    | root             | 127.0.0.1 | 2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19 |
    | debian-sys-maint | localhost | 03C2F472E5290DDE27E889681C90EA91FD6800F3 |
    |                  | %         |                                          |
    +------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+

Users are associated with a host, specifically, the host to which they connect.
The root user in this example is defined for **localhost**, for the IP address
of **localhost**, and the hostname of the server (**demohost** in this example).
You'll usually need to set a user for only one host, the one from which you
typically connect.

If you're running your application on the same computer as the MySQL
server the host that it connects to by default is **localhost**. Any new
users that you create must have **localhost** in their **host** field.

If your application connects remotely, the **host** entry that MySQL looks for
is the IP address or DNS hostname of the remote computer (the one from which
the client is coming).

A special value for the host is `%`, as you can see in the preceding output for
the blank, or anonymous, user (see the following section). The `%` symbol is
a wildcard ard that applies to any host value.

#### Anonymous users

In the example output, one entry has a host value but no username or password.
That's an *anonymous user*. When a client connects with no username specified,
it's trying to connect as an anonymous user.

You usually don't want any anonymous users, but some MySQL installations
include one by default. If you see one, you should either delete the user
(refer to the username with empty quotes, like '') or set a password for it.

### Create a database

There is a difference between a *database server* and a *database*, even though
those terms are often used interchangeably. MySQL is a database server, meaning
tracks databases and controls access to them. The database stores the data, and
it is the database that applications are trying to access when the interact
with MySQL.

Some applications create a database as part of their setup process, but others
require you to create a database yourself and tell the
application about it.

To create a database, log into the `mysql` shell and run the following command,
replacing `demodb` with the  name of the database that you want to create:

    CREATE DATABASE demodb;

The database is created. You can verify its creation by running a query  to
list all databases. The following example shows the query and example output:

    SHOW DATABASES;
    +--------------------+
    | Database           |
    +--------------------+
    | information_schema |
    | demodb             |
    | mysql              |
    +--------------------+
    3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

### Add a database user

When applications connect to the database using the root user, they usually have more privileges than they need. You can that applications can use to connect to the new database. In the following example, a user named **demouser** is created.

1. To create a new user, run the following command in the `mysql` shell:

    INSERT INTO mysql.user (User,Host,Password)
    VALUES('demouser','localhost',PASSWORD('demopassword'));

2. When you make changes to the **user** table in the **mysql** database, tell
   MySQL to read the changes by flushing the privileges, as follows:

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3. Verify that the user was created by running a SELECT query again:

    SELECT User, Host, Password FROM mysql.user;
    +------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
    | User             | Host      | Password                                 |
    +------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
    | root             | localhost | 2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19 |
    | root             | demohost  | 2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19 |
    | root             | 127.0.0.1 | 2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19 |
    | debian-sys-maint | localhost | 03C2F472E5290DDE27E889681C90EA91FD6800F3 |
    | demouser         | localhost | 0756A562377EDF6ED3AC45A00B356AAE6D3C6BB6 |
    +------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------+

### Grant database user permissions

Right after you create a new user, it has no privileges. The user can log in,
but it can't be used to make any database changes.

1. Give the user full permissions for your new database by running the
   following command:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON demodb.* to demouser@localhost;

2. Flush the privileges to make the change official by running the following
   command:

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3. To verify that those privileges were set, run the following command:

    SHOW GRANTS FOR 'demouser'@'localhost';
    2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

   MySQL returns the commands needed to reproduce that user's permissions if
   you were to rebuild the server. The `USAGE on \*.\*` part means the users
   gets no privileges on anything by default. That command is overridden by the
   second command, which is the grant you ran for the new database.

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Grants for demouser@localhost                                                                                   |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'demouser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*0756A562377EDF6ED3AC45A00B356AAE6D3C6BB6' |
    | GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `demodb`.* TO 'demouser'@'localhost'                                                    |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
