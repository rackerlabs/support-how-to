A common request we receive is, "Dear Rackspace, I've got a server in
your DFW region, and I want one exactly like it in SYD.  How can I make
that happen?"

You can make it happen by using Cloud Images.  This article explains how
to do it.

### Setting expectations

Before we get into the details, consider the following information:

-   You can't really copy a server.  Instead, you create an image of the
    server that you want to copy (by using either the Cloud Servers API
    or the Cloud Control Panel), export the image out of the source
    region (DFW in the example in this article), import it into the
    target region (SYD in this article), and then boot a new server in the target region 
    from the imported image.
    -   The *source region* is the region where the server you want to
        copy is located.
    -   The *target region* is the region where you want to build a new
        server just like the one you have in the source region.
-   Because not all images are exportable, not all images can
    be transferred. See [How can I tell if an image can
    exported?](/how-to/cloud-images-faq) in the Cloud Images FAQ for details.
-   Cloud Images is currently accessible only through the [Cloud Images
    v2 API](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-images/v2/developer-guide/);
    it's not available in the Cloud Control Panel yet.
-   Cloud Images uses only JSON. It does not use XML.

### Working in the source region

1.  Create an image of the source server.

    This example uses a server named Slave Database 3 in the
    source region.  You can use either the Cloud Servers API or the
    Cloud Control Panel to create the image.

2.  Optionally, use the metadata function of the API to assign an
    identifying property to the image.  If you want to transfer several
    images, we recommend that you perform this step to help organize
    your images and track them across regions.

    Use either the Cloud Images API or the Cloud Servers API (you cannot
    use the Control Panel) to put a "coordinating metadatum" on the new
    image.  This example uses an image ID
    of `a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90`.  You could create an
    image property named `com.mycompany.image-of` and give it the value
    `db-slave-3`.   You can add the metadatum by using the Images API,
    as in the following example:

        OS_AUTH_TOKEN="<your auth token>"
        OS_IMAGE_URL="<cloud images baseurl in source region>"
        MY_IMG="a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90"
        curl -X PATCH <br>
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN" <br>
          -H "Content-type: application/openstack-images-v2.1-json-patch" <br>
          -d '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/com.mycompany.image-of", "value": "db-slave-3"}]' <br>
          "$OS_IMAGE_URL/v2/images/$MY_IMG"

3.  You need a container in your Cloud Files account to put the exported
    image in. If you don't already have one, you can create a container
    by using the Cloud Control Panel, as follows:
    A. In the top navigation bar, click **Storage &gt; Files**.
    B. Click **Create Container**.
    C. Specify a name, the source region, and the container type.
    D. Click **Create Container**.
4.  Create a Cloud Images `export` task in the source region. When this
    task is executed, it copies the image in Cloud Images and puts the
    copy into the container named `exported-images` in your Cloud Files
    account (also in the source region).
5.  curl -X POST <br>
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN" <br>
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" <br>
          -d "{\"type\": \"export\", \"input\": {\"receiving_swift_container\": \"exported-images\", \"image_uuid\": \"$MY_IMG\"} }" <br>
          "$OS_IMAGE_URL/v2/tasks"

    Cloud Images returns a 201 (Created) response. The body of the
    response contains an `id` element whose value is the UUID of your
    export task. The response looks similar to the following one:

        {
            "created_at": "2014-02-26T02:01:13Z",
            "id": "7bdc8ede-9098-4d79-9477-697f586cb333",
            "input": {
                "image_uuid": "a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90",
                "receiving_swift_container": "exported-images"
            },
            "message": "None",
            "owner": "10000001",
            "schema": "/v2/schemas/task",
            "self": "/v2/tasks/7bdc8ede-9098-4d79-9477-697f586cb333",
            "status": "pending",
            "type": "export",
            "updated_at": "2014-02-26T02:01:13Z"
        }

    Note that the ID of the task in the above example is
    `7bdc8ede-9098-4d79-9477-697f586cb333`.

6.  Poll your task to monitor its status, by using the task ID. If your
    image is large, it might take some time to be processed and
    transferred to your Cloud Files account. Do not poll more frequently
    than every 30 seconds. Following is an example Cloud Images API call
    to check on your task:

        TASK="7bdc8ede-9098-4d79-9477-697f586cb333"
        curl -X GET <br>
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN" <br>
          "$OS_IMAGE_URL/v2/tasks/$TASK"

    The response has a `status` field that starts out as `pending`,
    changes to `processing` when the task is being worked on, and then
    reaches a final status of either `success` or `failure`. Following
    is an example of a successful task response:

        {
            "created_at": "2014-02-26T02:01:13Z",
            "expires_at": "2014-02-28T02:16:50Z",
            "id": "7bdc8ede-9098-4d79-9477-697f586cb333",
            "input": {
                "image_uuid": "a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90",
                "receiving_swift_container": "exported-images"
            },
            "message": "None",
            "owner": "10000001",
            "result": {
                "export_location": "exported-images/a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90.vhd"
            },
            "schema": "/v2/schemas/task",
            "self": "/v2/tasks/7bdc8ede-9098-4d79-9477-697f586cb333",
            "status": "success",
            "type": "export",
            "updated_at": "2014-02-26T02:16:50Z"
        }

    Note the `result` element in this response. It contains the location
    of the exported image in your Cloud Files account. The image is in
    the container that you specified and its file name follows the
    convention `{original_image_UUID}.vhd. `If you forget which image
    `a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90.vhd` is, you can look it up
    using either the Cloud Images or Cloud Servers API.

### Working between the regions

At this point, you need to download the image from your Cloud Files
account in the source region to a neutral location (you could use your
laptop or you could use a cloud server) and then upload the image from
the neutral location to your Cloud Files account in the target region.
How exactly you accomplish this is up to you. Here are some suggestions:

-   Use the
    [python-swiftclient](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-swiftclient).
-   Use [turbolift](https://github.com/cloudnull/turbolift).
-   Use [swiftly](https://github.com/gholt/swiftly):
    -   [Using Swiftly to download an exported
        image](/how-to/use-swiftly-to-download-an-exported-image)
    -   [Using Swiftly to upload an image to be
        imported](/how-to/use-swiftly-to-upload-an-image)

We don't recommend using the Cloud Control Panel for this operation.
Most images are large enough you would likely have a poor user
experience.  

### Working in the target region

This example assumes that the object
named  `a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90.vhd` is in a container
named `imported-files` in your Cloud Files account in the target region.

After you upload the image copy to Cloud Files in the target region, you
can import it for use with Cloud Servers.

1.  Create an `import` task in the target region by using the Cloud Images API.

        OS_AUTH_TOKEN="<your auth token>"
        OS_IMAGE_URL="<cloud images baseurl in target region>"
        IMAGE_CONTAINER="imported-files"
        IMAGE_FILE="a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90.vhd"
        IMAGE_NAME="Slave Database 3"
        curl -i -X POST <br>
          -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN" <br>
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" <br>
          -d "{\"type\": \"import\", \"input\": {\"import_from\": \"$IMAGE_CONTAINER/$IMAGE_FILE\", \"import_from_format\": \"vhd\", \"image_properties\" : {\"name\": \"$IMAGE_NAME\"} } }" <br>
          "$OS_IMAGE_URL/v2/tasks"

    Cloud Images returns a 201 (Created) response. The body of the
    response contains an `id` element whose value is the UUID of your
    import task. Suppose that the value of the `id` element is
    `d8dd8c24-2534-473c-881f-9097bc784068.`

2.  Poll your task to monitor its status, by using the task ID. As
    mentioned earlier, don't poll more frequently than every 30 seconds.
    Your task eventually goes to a status of success, and the body of
    the task detail response is similar to the following one:

        {
            "created_at": "2014-02-26T03:02:23Z",
            "expires_at": "2014-02-28T03:28:18Z",
            "id": "d8dd8c24-2534-473c-881f-9097bc784068",
            "input": {
                "image_properties": {
                    "name": "Slave Database 3"
                },
                "import_from": "exported-images/a6da1504-e1c0-4f40-8461-1ed9a9990e90.vhd",
                "import_from_format": "vhd"
            },
            "message": "None",
            "owner": "10000001",
            "result": {
                "image_id": "1d944ab7-6748-4f3c-b7e2-3553bf006677"
            },
            "schema": "/v2/schemas/task",
            "self": "/v2/tasks/d8dd8c24-2534-473c-881f-9097bc784068",
            "status": "success",
            "type": "import",
            "updated_at": "2014-02-26T03:28:18Z"
        }

    Note the `result` element, which contains the `image_id` of the
    imported image.

3.  If you put a coordinating metadatum on the original image in the
    source region, now put the same coordinating metadatum on the image
    you just imported, namely, `1d944ab7-6748-4f3c-b7e2-3553bf006677`.
    You can use the same Cloud Images API call as you used in the source
    region, just ensure that you set `MY_IMG` to the new image ID and
    that you set `OS_AUTH_TOKEN` and `OS_IMAGE_URL` are set properly for
    the target region.

    What's the purpose of this coordinating metadatum? Images are stored
    differently inside the cloud - they're not in the same VHD format used
    for image interchange. Thus, you can't use the checksum on your
    image in the source region to determine which of your images in the
    target region corresponds to it - there won't be an image with
    that checksum. You can't use the source image's UUID either, because
    the image in the target region has a different UUID. But if you put
    the same coordinating metadatum on each image, you can use the
    advanced list filtering features of the Cloud Images API to locate
    the image in each region:

        OS_AUTH_TOKEN="<your auth token>"
        OS_IMAGE_URL="<cloud images baseurl>"
        curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN" "$OS_IMAGE_URL/v2/images?com.mycompany.image-of=db-slave-3

    As long as you use different values for each set of images that are
    related, the response to this call will be a list of images that
    contain just one image.

4.  You can now create a server in the target region with the
    imported image. You can use the Cloud Servers API or the Cloud
    Control Panel for this task.
    
5.  To find your imported image in the image selector on the Create
    Server page of the Control Panel, click **Saved** under **Image**,
    and among the saved images, look for the images of **Deleted
    Server**. Because the imported image is not an image of any server
    in the target region, the Control Panel shows the server as deleted.
