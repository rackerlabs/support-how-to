### Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by VMware

**Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by VMware**(RPC-V) provides a single-tenant
hosted private cloud, designed with server, storage, and networking
hardware from trusted vendors such as Dell&reg;, EMC&reg;, and
Cisco&reg;, that's proactively managed 24x7x365 by our VMware
Certified Professionals. For more information, see the following resources:

### VMware Server Virtualization

**VMware Server Virtualization** is a simple, easy-to-consume, managed VMware
environment that's perfect for small and medium-sized businesses that want
to offload the maintenance and monitoring of the guest operating system (OS), VMware software
stack, and underlying hardware to Rackspace. For more information, see the following resources:
