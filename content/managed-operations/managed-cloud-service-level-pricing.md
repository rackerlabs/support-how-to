The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your total cloud expense by splitting the cost of infrastructure and support. The support cost, or "Service Level Rate", is determined by the total compute power used. The infrastructure Rate is based on the amount of GB of RAM used during the billing cycle, and not on the types of server. This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger servers. For instance, 20 1-GB servers cost the same as 10 2-GB servers.

### Infrastructure and Service Level Rates

 The following table illustrates, a savings of $87.60 per month for Infrastructure Service Level customers upgrading to Managed Infrastructure:

| | Infrastructure | Infrastructure Rate (month) | Service Level Rate (month) | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure Service Level | 10 x 4 GB Servers (4 GB Server is $0.16/hr) | $1168.00  (10 x $0.16/hr x 730 hrs) |  $0.00  (Bundled in Infrastructure) | $1,168.00
| Managed Infrastructure | 10 x 4 GB Servers (4 GB Server is $0.128/hr) | $934.40 (10 x $0.128/hr x 730 hrs) | $146.00 (40 GB x 730 hrs x $0.005) |  $1,080.40

### What is the Service Level Rate?

The Service Level Rate covers maintenance and support of all your cloud compute products (such as servers). It is based upon your service level. The Managed Infrastructure rate is $0.005 per gigabyte hour; the Managed Operations rate is $0.02 per gigabyte hour. OnMetal servers have a flat hourly rate independent of RAM.

The minimum Service Level Rate for Managed Infrastructure is $50; for Managed Operations, it is $500. If you do not meet the minimum during your billing cycle, the difference is assessed to your account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but the Service Level Rate is only assessed against compute products. Storage services such as Cloud Files and Cloud Block Storage have no Service Level Rates associated with them. There are no minimums for Standard Cloud Servers at the Managed Infrastructure level.
