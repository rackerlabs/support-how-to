To use Rackspace Intelligence, you must have a dedicated Rackspace
customer account and you must be logged in to the
[MyRackspace Customer Portal](https://my.rackspace.com) portal for that account.
Rackspace Intelligence has no separate login process.

To access Rackspace Intelligence:

1.  Go to [MyRackspace Customer Portal](https://my.rackspace.com) and log in to the portal by
    providing your **Rackspace Account Number**, **Username** and
    **Password**.

2.  On the [MyRackspace Customer Portal](https://my.rackspace.com), click **Services** and then
    select **Availability Monitoring** from the list.

    This takes you to the **Entities** page, which lists all of your
    available entities. From this page, you can explore all the details
    for the entities that have been configured for you.

features that pertain to your entities. For more information, see
