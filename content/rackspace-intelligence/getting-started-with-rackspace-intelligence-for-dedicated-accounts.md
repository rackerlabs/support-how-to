**Note:** This guide is for Rackspace Intelligence on a dedicated
account. If you have a standard cloud account, click
[here](/how-to/getting-started-with-rackspace-intelligence-for-the-cloud)
for the applicable getting started guide.

Rackspace Intelligence now supports dedicated customer accounts.
Dedicated customers can use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to view
their availability monitors.

Rackspace Intelligence provides a data panel, called a *dashboard*, that
shows actionable insights into infrastructure health.

As a customer with a dedicated account:

-   Use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to view the availability of
    your applications.
-   Create customized visualizations and graphs.
-   Use remote checks of type
    [ping](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-ping), [tcp](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-tcp),
    and
