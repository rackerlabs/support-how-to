This article is to assist you if you are experiencing Cloud Backup issues that
are caused by the backup agent being disconnected on the Linux&reg; instance including
the following items:

* Backups are not running.
* Backups take too long to complete.
* Cloud Backup uses all of the server’s resources.

As a Managed Infrastructure customer who administers your own servers, this article
helps you to diagnose if the server is experiencing an issue that you can remedy,
or if the issue should be escalated to a member of 
Rackspace Support. This article provides helpful information that you
can include when you create a ticket that might expedite the response.

## Check for open issues

Before you restart the DriveClient service, check [status.rackspace.com](https://status.rackspace.com)
to ensure that there are no Cloud Backup open issues that could be impacting your server instance.
In addition, check the current support tickets to ensure that there has not been an incident that is
causing the lack of accessibility of the server. To check your open support ticket, log in to the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) and click **Tickets > Ticket List** in the top
navigation bar. 

If there is no open support ticket about the server in question, attempt to establish a connection
as shown in the next section.

## Establish connection

1. In the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com), click on
   **Backups > Systems**.
   
2. From the list of Cloud Backup systems, click the backup server name.
   This action displays the following details about the backup system:
   
   - The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the server
   - The system type
   - The server region
   - If encryption is enabled
   - The backup region 
   - The agent version
   
3. To the right of the system name, review the status of the backup agent. The backup
   status is **connected** or **disconnected**.
   
4. Wait 10 seconds to ensure that the status is accurate because it can change after a few seconds.

5. After 10 seconds, perform one of the following actions:

   - If the status is **connected**, try to run the backup again, and if it fails, contact Rackspace Support.
   - If the status is **disconnected**, restart the DriveClient service as shown in the next section.

## Restart DriveClient service

1. To restart the DriveClient service, log in to the server via RDP and click the
   **Start** button in the bottom-left corner of the Windows&reg; desktop.
   
2. In the **Search** field, search for **services.msc**.

3. Click **services** in the **Programs** field.

4. Locate the **Driveclient Service** in the **Services (Local)** list.

5. Right-click on **Driveclient Service** and then choose the **Restart** option.

6. A pop-up displays the status of the restart.

7. After the restart is complete, find the **DriveClient Service** again in the **Services (Local)**
   list, and ensure that its status is **Started**.
   
8. A common reason for the driveclient not showing as started is that it is not set to start after
   a reboot. To resolve this problem, right-click on the **DriveClient Service** and choose **Properties**.
  
9. Click the drop-down menu next to **Startup type** and select (if not already selected) **Automatic**.

10. Click **OK** at the bottom of the page.

11. After the service is restarted, check the Control Panel again to check the backup status.
   
    - If the status is **connected**, try to run the backup again, and if it fails, contact
      Rackspace Support.
    - If the status is **disconnected**, download the backup log from within Windows on the server.
      The log is located at C:\ProgramData\Driveclient\log\driveclient.log. To expedite the issue
      response, attach this log to a ticket for Rackspace Support.
