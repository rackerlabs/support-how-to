Backup statuses
-------------------

Descriptions for each of the backup statues follow along with tips for
why you might receive each status and what action you might take.

### Backup status "Skipped"

The backup job was skipped because a backup job was already queued. A
single backup job can be queued only once.

A backup status of Skipped likely occurs because the frequency of the
backup job is set too high (for example, hourly) and a single backup
takes too long (longer than an hour). The backup scheduler will start to
skip backups that it cannot meet.

Consider reducing the frequency of the job, or reducing the amount of
data. If this is the initial job, the subsequent jobs might finish
faster.

On older DriveClient installations, a Skipped status might be caused if
the agent was hard-restarted (or the operating system was rebooted)
during a backup, cleanup, or restore.

For Linux, a possible fix is to upgrade to the latest version of
DriveClient and restart the running agent.

For Windows, a  possible fix is to restart the DriveClient Windows
service through Window's Service Manager, or through the `sc` command
line Windows utility.


### Backup status "Missed"

A status of Missed indicates that the backup job was missed. The
DriveClient service was likely not running at the time of the scheduled
backup, and the agent was therefore offline.

Verify that the agent is running on the server. If the agent is not
already running, start it. Next, check the logs to determine why the
backup job failed.

An agent should never go offline by itself. If the agent did not
respond, then the agent could not reach one of the API endpoints, the
agent was not running, or the agent was manually stopped or
terminated.


### Backup status "Completed with Errors"

A backup status of Completed with Errors indicates that the backup
completed, but one or more files could not be backed up. The most common
issues that cause this type of status are as follows:

-   The file was deleted between the time the index of files completed,
    and the copy of that specific file was attempted. This issue is
    common with any temporary files, such as PHP session files.
-   The file was exclusively locked (Windows), so that no other process
    could read it. This issue is common with database binary files. With
    databases, you should never back up the binaries themselves, but
    rather dump the contents of the database to a flag file (such as an
    SQL file), and back up that flat file. Doing so allows for a quicker
    backup and an easier restore. We suggest that you break individual
    databases into different flat files, so that they can be manipulated
    easier on restore. Then,  you do not have to fully restore the flat
    file just to restore a single database.
-   You will see a `Path Not Found` message when non-UTF-8 characters
    are used in the path of the file in the operating system. The
    current version of Cloud Backup supports only UTF-8 characters.


### Backup status "Error"

Many issues might cause a backup status of Error to occur, such as Cloud
account permissions for the user who configured that agent or the
DriveClient not being able to connect to the agent APIs.

Rackspace Support must review the DriveClient.log file to determine the
cause. If the agent is not connected, attach the DriveCliet.log file to
a ticket so that Support can review it.

Following are some of the issues and some possible fixes:

-   `Missing Password for encrypted volume`

    Possible cause: If you use the API to change an account from
    ServiceNet to PublicNet, the volume URI is changed. However, the
    **bootstrap.json** file doesn't reflect that change.
    Workaround: Edit the **bootstrap.json** file and change the
    volume URI.
    -   If the account was changed *from* ServiceNet to PublicNet,
        remove the snet- prefix from the volume URI.
    -   If the account was changed *to* ServiceNet from PublicNet, add
        an snet- prefix to the volume URI.

-   `Out of Disk Space`

    If the local system has less than 100 MB of free disk space, the
    backup cannot properly decompress the local backup vault database to
    execute a backup or restore.

-   `Container does not exist`

    The container that is used to store backup data has been deleted.
    You can check this by getting the agent details via the Cloud
    Backup API. The `VolumeURI` field in the displayed JSON indicates
    the Cloud Files container that Cloud Backup is attempting to access.
    If that Cloud Files container does not exist, it must be recreated.
    It also means that any previous backups were deleted and cannot be
    used to restore.

-   `CurlEasyPerformWrapper : Could not perform an HTTP request. Connection timed out while waiting for https://snet-storage101`

    This message indicates that a networking error is causing
    DriveClient to be unable to connect to the Cloud Files API to upload
    backups.

-   `locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid`

    This message is caused by the locale not being properly set on the
    target system, which happens mostly in older operating systems.

    Receiving this message is also common when you use SSH to connect
    from a MacOS desktop to a Linux server, and run the
    `sudo service DriveClient status command`.  The MacOS client does
    not properly provide the locale information in the SSH session.

    If you don't have a Linux computer available for use, you can access
    the web console for your server via the Cloud Control Panel. When
    you're in to the web console for your server, perform the following
    actions:

    1. Open the **/etc/ssh/sshd\_config** file for editing.
    2. Find the lines that start with `AcceptEnv`, and insert a `#`
    character in front of each line. The issue seems to be related to
    one of the localization variables that is being passed. Disabling
    acceptance of those variables is a workaround.
    3. After you make the change and save the file, restart the SSH
    service (depending on the Linux distribution), run
    either` service ssh restart` or `service sshd restart`.

    Then, try to connect again.


### Backup status "Failed"

The Failed status indicates that a serious problem occurred, and the
backup job did not run. As with the Error status, check the logs on the
server.


### Connection errors: DriveClient fails to start, or DriveClient does not stay running

When DriveClient is started, it attempts to connect to the RSE API
endpoint (**rse.drivesrvr.com** or **rse.drivesrvr.co.uk**), to let the
API know that it is available to take commands.  If it can't reach that
endpoint, or the associated **api.drivesrvr.com** or
**api.drivesrvr.co.uk**, it will automatically stop the service.

The following symptoms might occur:

-   On Windows, the following permissions error message might be
    displayed: `Please check your permissions and try again`. This is
    default error message that Windows displays when a service fails
    to start.
-   On Linux, the agent will just shut itself down.

When the agent shuts itself down, you see a line, similar to the
following line, indicating that the logging is being stopped.  This is
the last thing that is logged before the agent shuts itself off.

`INFO |root|rax::AgentPolicy::TearDown(38)] Tearing down logging...`

You will also see this as a `Disconnected` agent through the **Backups**
area of the Cloud Control Panel.

The agent might be unable to communicate with one or more the following
required API endpoints:

-   Cloud Backup API: **api.drivesrvr.com** (for US accounts) or
    **api.drivesrvr.co.uk** (for UK accounts)
    You can test this communication with an HTTP GET (or Open Standard
    Web Browser) to the
    URL <https://api.drivesrvr.com/v1.0/help/apihealth>.

-   Cloud Backup RSE API: **rse.drivesrvr.com** (for US accounts) or
    **rse.drivesrvr.co.uk** (for UK accounts)
    You can test this communication with an HTTP GET (or Open Standard
    Web Browser) to the URL <https://rse.drivesrvr.com/health>.

-   Cloud Files API endpoints: These are regional endpoints, but all
    have the same /healthcheck command that allows for network
    connection testing.
    You can test this communication with an HTTP GET:
    <https://%3Cendpoint%3E/healthcheck> using regional public and
    ServiceNet endpoints, which are shown below. For example,
    <https://storage101.ord1.clouddrive.com/healthcheck>.


| Region | Public API                     | ServiceNet API                      |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ORD    | storage101.ord1.clouddrive.com | snet-storage101.ord1.clouddrive.com |
| DFW    | storage101.dfw1.clouddrive.com | snet-storage101.dfw1.clouddrive.com |
| IAD    | storage101.iad3.clouddrive.com | snet-storage101.iad3.clouddrive.com |
| LON    | storage101.lon3.clouddrive.com | snet-storage101.lon3.clouddrive.com |
| SYD    | storage101.syd2.clouddrive.com | snet-storage101.syd2.clouddrive.com |
| HKG    | storage101.hkg1.clouddrive.com | snet-storage101.hkg1.clouddrive.com |


### Backup agent logs: Where they are located, and how to read them

The agent logs are stored, by default, in the following directories:

-   (Windows) **C:\\ProgramData\\DriveClient\\logs\\DriveClient.log**
    The **C:\\ProgramData\\DriveClient** directory can be changed, based
    on the installer or through the AgentConfig.exe executable.

-   (Linux) **/var/log/DriveClient.log**

The only thing that can be manually edited in the **log4cxx.xml** file
(Log configuration) is the size of the **DriveClient.log** file
(`MaxFileSize`) and how many previous versions (`MaxBackupIndex`) will
be saved before they are deleted. For more information about how to
configure this file, see [Cloud Backup agent logging
basics](/how-to/cloud-backup-agent-logging-basics).

The following common items are included in the **DriveClient.log** file:

-   `rax::LoggingPolicy::PerformSetup(134)` -
    Indicates the start of the DriveClient service.

-   `rax::AgentPolicy::TearDown(38)] Tearing down logging...` -
    Indicates that the DriveClient service was properly shut down.

-   `[DATE TIME | THREADID | LOGLEVEL | USER | CONTEXT] LOG INFORMATION`-
    Format of log lines.
    - `DATE TIME`: Timestamp indicating when the log line was written
    - `THREADID`: Because DriveClient is a threaded service, this ID is an
      indicator to separate the thread from all of the other threads
      writing to the same log file.
    - `LOGLEVEL`: The depth of the logging. The default is INFO, but
      Support might increase this level to TRACE or DEBUG. The log levels
      are common log levels, such as INFO, WARN, and ERROR.
    - `USER`: The user that is running the service. On Linux,  this value
      is root, and on Windows, it is Administrator.
    - `CONTEXT`: This is internal information about where the log was
       generated.
    - `LOG INFORMATION`: The context of the log.

Common errors received in the log include 401 and 403 errors when
accessing **rse.drivesrvr.com**, **api.drivesrvr.com**,
**rse.drivesrvr.co.uk**, or **api.drivesrvr.co.uk**.

When you first start the DriveClient service, there is a possibility
that the RSA key pair for authentication does not properly synchornize
immediately, causing a brief time of 401 and 403 errors in the
**DriveClient.log** file. This is normal for the Cloud Backup internal
APIs. The DriveClient service handles these errors and will retry the
appropriate number of times before canceling the startup of that
service.

If the errors continue for more than 5 - 10 seconds, contact Rackspace
Support.

### Recovery of your encrypted vault password

You cannot recover your encrypted vault password. The vault password is
stored only on the cloud server that is linked to that encrypted vault.
If that password is forgotten, and the **bootstrap.json** file was
overwritten or lost, there is no way to recover the password.

### Unable to backup or restore files (Windows only)

Windows has the ability to *exclusively lock* a file, so that no other
process can read or write to it. This locking is common in database
binary files, but many other programs use this locking protocol. If this
locking occurs, the only workarounds are to close the program that has
the exclusive lock, or restore the file into a different location.

If you are backing up a file that you know will be exclusively locked,
you should think about using VSS snapshots (if your version of Windows
supports it), and back up the contents of the VSS snapshot. Using VSS
snapshots enables you to get a proper backup of the file.

The latest version of Cloud Backup for Windows automatically takes a VSS
snapshot of the drive and attempts to back up files from it.

### System resource utilization

The amount of resources (memory, CPU, and load) used by the DriveClient
is directly related to how many files are being backed up in each backup
configuration. An increased number of files (or the size of files) can
cause the agent to consume more resources. For suggestions for best
practices, see [Best practices for Cloud
Backup](/how-to/best-practices-for-cloud-backup).

### Other errors and problems

Following are other errors and problems that you might encounter:

#### **Backup failed with a 403 error from Cloud Files when account has sub-users**

A registered sub-user is authorized for Cloud Backup but not for Cloud
Files access. When this user attempts a backup, all requests to Cloud
Files return a 403 error. The user attempts to authenticate again, but
the new authentication token is the same as the old one.

Account administrators can manage permission levels in the User
Management section of the Cloud Control Panel. Submit a request to your
account administrator for Full access to your account or Administrative
access to Cloud Files for your sub-user account. Cloud Backup does not
support Dedicated Users with Cloud access Federated users.

#### **Unable to browse a previous backup or browse a backup to select files to restore**

The list of files in a backup in the Cloud Control Panel is generated by
the running DriveClient service. When you are browsing existing backup
reports that have not been rotated because of retention policies, this
information is generated on that cloud server.

When you attempt to restore, the file list is generated on the target
cloud server - the server to which you have selected to restore the
files.

#### **Cleanup stuck in "preparing" mode**

The cleanup process requires a large number of calculations before it
can start cleaning up for the file rotation. As a result, the cleanup
process could be shown as *preparing* for some time before the files
start being rotated. There is no way to track the percentage complete at
this time.

#### **Unexpected "Skipped" notifications for a backup**

You might get this notification if you have reregistered servers (the
old server appears offline with a duplicate online server). By design,
scheduled backups for offline servers send a notification of Skipped. To
discontinue getting these notifications for offline servers, select
**Disable** from the **Actions** menu for the **Backup Configuration**.

**WARNING**: We do *not* recommend reregistering a DriveClient agent,
especially if the server has existing backup configurations and data
backed up. Reregistering disassociates the server from the prior backup
configurations and backed up data.

If you have reregistered a DriveClient agent and are unintentionally
disassociated from your backups, you can use the [Migrate Vault API
call](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-backup/v1/developer-guide/#migrate-vault)
to migrate the previous backup vault from a previous agent to a new
fresh agent (with no backup configurations or previous backups run
against it).

#### **Files modified during backup are missing or corrupted**

**Note**: This issue relates to the data that is backed up, and not to
the actual file on the file system.

The following types of file changes can occur during a backup:

-   Files are overwritten or get deleted. These files are not guaranteed
    to have usable content or to even be included in the backup at all.
-   Files, like logs, are appended to. We will make a best effort to
    back up these files, but we expect to be able to restore a
    reasonable and usable form of these files.
-   Files, like databases, might have random updates to any part
    of them. We do not in any way guarantee that these files will be
    restorable, and even if they are restored, we do not guarantee that
    what is restored is not corrupt.

These file types either change too rapidly (databases, logs, caches) or
don't exist long enough to be backed up (session files). Session files
should be avoided entirely. And if the information is valuable to your
business, log files should track it. Caches should also be avoided, as
their data is meant to be discarded.

If you need to back up these types of files, we recommend the following
workarounds:

-   For databases, take a snapshot of the database (for example, a
    database dump) and back up the dump. See [Rackspace Cloud Backup -
    Backing up
    Databases](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-backup-backing-up-databases)
    for full instructions.
-   For log files, take snapshots of your log files and back them up. To
    avoid running out of disk space, rotate your log files periodically.
