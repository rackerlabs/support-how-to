When you create a maintenance backup plan in SQL Server 2008 R2, you
must identify how you want the plan to be set up. In this example, the
maintenance plan is set up with full backups, differentials, and
transactions logs.

### Check SQL Server Agent service

Verify that the SQL Server Agent service is running and set to
automatic. The maintenance plan depends on this service to run.

1.  On the server, open the **Run** dialog box, type in **services.msc**
    and press **Enter**.

2.  Find the SQL Server Agent service in the list and double-click it.

3.  Click the **Recovery** tab and set the failure value to **Restart
    the Service**.

4.  Click the **General** tab, and select **Automatic** as the startup type,
    and then start the service by clicking on **Start**.

### Create the maintenance plan

1.  Launch the SQL Management Studio and log in.

2.  In the Object Explorer pane, expand the **Management** folder, right-click on **Maintenance Plans**, and the select **Maintenance Plan Wizard**.

3.  On the welcome page of the wizard, click **Next**.

4.  On the Select Plan Properties page, specify a name for the plan,
    select **Separate schedules for each task**, and then click
    **Next**.

5.  On the Select Maintenance Tasks page, select the **Back Up
    Database (Full)**,  **Back Up Database (Differential)**, and **Back
    Up Database (Transaction Log)** check boxes, and then click
    **Next**.

6.  On the Select Maintenance Task Order page, leave the order as shown,
    and then click **Next**.

### Define full backup settings

On the Define Back Up Database (Full) Task page, set up the full backup
according to the following instructions.

1.  Select the databases that you want to back up (typically **All user
    databases**).

2.  Specify when you want the backups to expire. In the following
    example, 14 days is specified.

    **Note**: This setting overwrites the oldest backup file
    for rotation.

3.  Select your backup media (typically **Disk**).

4.  Specify a location (either Default or as assigned by you) for your
    backup files.

5.  Select the **Verify backup integrity** check box.

6.  To configure the scheduling options for this task, click **Change**
    near the bottom of the page.

7.  In the Job Schedule Properties dialog box, select **Recurring** for
    the Schedule type.

8.  Specify the frequency of the backup. The following example shows
    full backups running on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Alter this to
    fit your backup plan.

9.  Adjust the daily frequency according to when your backup needs
    to run.

10. Under **Duration**, adjust the **Start** and **End** dates. In the
    example **No end date** is selected.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-backup/create-a-maintenance-backup-plan-in-sql-server-2008-r2-using-the-wizard/fullbackupsetttings2.png %}" width="680" height="591" />

11. Click **OK**.

12. On the Define Back Up Database (Full) Task page of the Maintenance
    Plan Wizard, click **Next**.

### Define differential Backup Settings

On the Define Back Up Database (Differential) Task page, set up the
differential backup according to the following instructions. The
settings are similar to the settings for the full backup.

1.  Select the databases that you want to back up (typically **All user
    databases**).

2.  Specify when you want the backups to expire.

3.  Select your backup media (typically **Disk**).

4.  Specify a location (either Default or as assigned by you) for your
    backup files.

5.  Select the **Verify backup integrity** check box.

6.  To configure the scheduling options for this task, click **Change**
    near the bottom of the page.

7.  In the Job Schedule Properties dialog box, select **Recurring** for
    the schedule type.

8.  Specify the frequency of the backup. For example, you could choose
    to run differential backups on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
    and Sunday.

9.  Under **Duration**, adjust the daily frequency according to when
    your backup needs to run.

10. Adjust the **Start** and **End** dates.

11. Click **OK**.

12. On the Define Back Up Database (Differential) Task page of the
    Maintenance Plan Wizard, click **Next**.

### Define transaction log backup settings

On the Define Back Up Database (Transaction Log) Task page, set up the
transaction log backup according to the following instructions.

1.  Select the databases that you want to back up (typically **All user
    databases**).

2.  Do *not* select the **Backup set will expire** check box.

    Expiration of transaction log backups is configured in the next
    section, "Set up the transaction log cleanup task."

3.  Select your backup media (typically **Disk**).

4.  Specify a location (either Default or as assigned by you) for your
    backup files.

5.  Copy the path for the backup file and paste it to Notepad. You will
    need to refer to this path in later steps.

6.  Select the **Verify backup integrity** check box.

7.  To configure the scheduling options for this task, click **Change**
    near the bottom of the page.

    **Note**: You need to determine transaction log backup intervals
    based on transaction log growth. It might be necessary to run the
    transaction log backups at shorter intervals to prevent transaction
    logs from growing.

8.  In the Job Schedule Properties dialog box, select **Recurring** for
    the Schedule type.

9.  Specify the frequency of the backup. In the following example, the
    transaction log backups are running daily.

10. Adjust the daily frequency. In the following example, this is set to
    run every hour.

11. Under **Duration**, adjust the **Start date** and **End date**
    fields.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-backup/create-a-maintenance-backup-plan-in-sql-server-2008-r2-using-the-wizard/TransactionLogBackupSettings2.png %}" width="594" height="518" />

12. Click **OK**.

13. On the Define Back Up Database (Transaction Log) Task page of the
    Maintenance Plan Wizard, click **Next**.

14. On the Select Report Options page, specify how you want to save the
    details of the maintenance plan, and then click **Next**.

15. On the Complete the Wizard page, click **Finish**.

16. On the Maintenance Plan Wizard Progress page, click **Close**.

17. When you are returned to the SQL Server Management Studio main
    window, press **F5** to refresh the maintenance plan with the new
    settings.

    The new maintenance plan is listed under **Maintenance Plans** in
    the Object Explorer pane.

### Set up the transaction Log Cleanup Task

This section demonstrates how to set up a maintenance cleanup task. This
task is set to clean up the transaction logs after three days. This
setting keeps the one-hour transaction logs for three days, until the
maintenance cleanup task deletes the old data. The transaction log
cleanup must include a series of three days, which ensures that if you
need to revert back to the second differential backup, you can apply the
transaction logs from that time period. The goal is to have enough
transaction log backups between the full and differential backups.

1.  Click the maintenance plan name.

2.  In the Design pane, select **Subplan_3**.

3.  In the Toolbox pane, select **Maintenance Cleanup Task** and drag it
    into the transaction log backup area under the Design pane.

4.  Right-click on the **Maintenance Cleanup Task** and choose
    **Edit**.

5.  In the Maintenance Cleanup Task dialog box, select **Backup files**.

6.  Select **Search folder and delete files based on an extension**.

7.  In the **Folder** text box, enter the path that you pasted into
    Notepad in the previous task. Ensure that you include the same path
    that your transaction logs are backing up to.

8.  Enter the file extension type, **trn**.  Do *not* precede the
    extension with a period.

9.  Select the **Include the first-level sub-folders** check box.

10. Select the **Delete files based on the age of the file at task run
    time** check box, and set the file age to **3 Days**.

11. Click **OK** to return to the Management Studio main window.

12. Drag the green arrow from the differential backup task to the
    maintenance cleanup task.

13. Double-click the connected green line.

14. In the Precedence Constraint Editor, set **Value** to Completion.

    This setting allows the task to become conditional, meaning that if
    the differential backup did not run, then the transaction cleanup
    task is not run, or if the backup did run, the cleanup task is
    run.

15. Click **OK** to return to the Management Studio main window.
    The line should now appear blue.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-backup/create-a-maintenance-backup-plan-in-sql-server-2008-r2-using-the-wizard/TransactionLogCleanupTask6.png %}" width="366" height="309" />

16. Save your work by selecting **Save All** from the File menu.
    You have finished setting up your maintenance backup plan. You can
    adjust your backup plan to your needs, but you should first test it.

### Test your setup

After you finish setting up your maintenance plan, verify that it
works. You can wait a few days to see if the job completes, or you can
force the job to run by performing the following steps.

1.  In the Object Explorer pane of SQL Server Management Studio, browse
    to **SQL Server Agent > Jobs**.

2.  Right-click the maintenance plan and select **Start Job at Step**.

    This command runs the first section of the maintenance plan.

3.  If the job completes without error, run the next step of the
    maintenance plan and test-run the setup. Repeat this step for all
    subplans that you created in the maintenance plan.

If all of your steps run without error, your maintenance plan works and
you are finished.

### Troubleshoot errors by viewing the job history

If any of the jobs fail when testing the maintenance plan, view the job
history to see what failed.

1.  In the Object Explorer pane, right-click the failed subplan and
    select **View History**.

    The Log File Viewer window, which shows the job history, is
    displayed.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-backup/create-a-maintenance-backup-plan-in-sql-server-2008-r2-using-the-wizard/Errors2_0.png %}" width="604" height="320" />

    If the job failed a red X icon is displayed next to the time that
    you ran the job.

2.  Click the row for the failed job.

    Details about the error appear below the table. Scroll or expand the
    pane to see more information.

3.  Troubleshoot the error and repeat the test-job.

When your maintenance plan is reliable, check it in a few days to see if
it is running as expected. Verify that the **.bak** files are being
removed after the expiration and that the transaction logs are being
cleaned up after three days.
