This guide provides the instructions for adding a new node to scale a multi-node WordPress 
environment that was created by using Rackspace Orchestration.

**Note:** If you need to scale a single WordPress instance, we recommend that you create a 
new multi-node WordPress stack and migrate your data. Many WordPress plug-ins, such as 
[duplicator](http://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) or 
[WP Migrate DB](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/), can help with this process.

### Creating the node

1. Log in to [the Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Orchestration > Stacks**.

3. On the Stacks page, click the name of the stack that you want to scale.

4. In the Infrastructure section of the stack details page, click the name of the first web 
   node (web01) to load the cloud server details page.

5. In the server details page, go to the **Actions** menu, and select **Create Image**.

6. When prompted, enter a name for the image and click **Create Image**.

7. To monitor the image creation progress, click **View Images** in the Images section of 
   the server details page. After the image is created, the image name, and its creation 
   time stamp, are displayed.

8. Under Images, click **View *n* Image**.

9. In the popup dialog box, click the gear icon next to the name of the new image, and 
   select **Create Server with Image** from the menu.

10. On the server creation page, enter a name for the new server, and select the region 
    where it will be created.

    We recommend following the stack naming convention (for example, web02.example.com), 
    and creating the new server in the same region as the other nodes in the stack.

11. In the Image section of the page, select the newly created image.

12. Select a size for the new node, then click **Create Server** at the bottom of the page.

### Preparing the new node

After the server is created and active, you need to make a few adjustments before it is 
ready to be used by WordPress.

1. From the server detail page, note the ServiceNet IP address of the new server. You will 
   need this information in a later step.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-orchestration/how-to-scale-multinode-wordpress-by-using-rackspace-orchestration/cpservicenet.png %}" width="600" border="2" alt=""  />

2. Click the **Orchestration** link at the top of the page and return to the stack that you 
   are scaling out.

3. In the Infrastructure section of the stack's page, click the link for the master server 
   in the list of nodes.

4. From the master server's detail page, find the PublicNet IP address in the Networks 
   section and use it to log in to your server via SSH.

   If you do not have the stack's private key, you can reset the master server's root password.

   For help using the SSH key with your server, see the How To article on the subject for 
   [Mac/Linux](/how-to/logging-in-with-an-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac) or 
   [Windows](/how-to/logging-in-with-an-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

5. After you have logged in to the master server, change the directory to `/etc/lsyncd` and 
   open the `lsyncd.conf.lua` file with `nano`.


    cd /etc/lsyncd
    sudo nano lsyncd.conf.lua


    The file's contents should look something like the following (you might have more 
    sections depending on how many servers you have):


    settings = {
       logfile    = "/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd.log",
       statusFile = "/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd-status.log",
       statusInterval = 5,
       pidfile = "/var/run/lsyncd.pid"
    }
    sync{
            default.rsync,
            source="/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs",
            target="wp_user@10.176.129.22:/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs",
            excludeFrom="/etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.exclude",
            rsyncOps={"-rlpgoDvz", "-e", "/usr/bin/ssh -i /var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/.ssh/id_rsa.lsyncd -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"}
    }


6. Copy the last `sync{ ... }` section and paste a new copy at the end of the file.

7. Replace the IP address in the value for `target` in the new `sync` block with the 
   ServiceNet IP of the new server that you created earlier.


    The line to edit looks similar to `target="wp_user@10.176.129.22:/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs"`, 
    as in the following example:


    settings = {
       logfile    = "/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd.log",
       statusFile = "/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd-status.log",
       statusInterval = 5,
       pidfile = "/var/run/lsyncd.pid"
    }
    sync{
            default.rsync,
            source="/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs",
            target="wp_user@10.176.129.22:/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs",
            excludeFrom="/etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.exclude",
            rsyncOps={"-rlpgoDvz", "-e", "/usr/bin/ssh -i /var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/.ssh/id_rsa.lsyncd -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"}
    }
    sync{
            default.rsync,
            source="/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs",
            target="wp_user@10.176.130.89:/var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/http_docs",
            excludeFrom="/etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.exclude",
            rsyncOps={"-rlpgoDvz", "-e", "/usr/bin/ssh -i /var/www/vhosts/iloveblog.rackspace.com/.ssh/id_rsa.lsyncd -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"}
    }


8. When you are finished, press `Ctrl-o` and `Enter` to write the changes, and then press 
   `Ctrl+x` to exit `nano`.

9. Now that the configuration is updated, restart `lsyncd`.


    sudo service lsyncd restart


10. Check the `lsyncd` log to verify that content is being pushed to the new server.


    # cat /var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd.log

    You should see something like the preceding example log, with the new server's IP 
    address in the log and a list of files that have been synchronized since `lsyncd` 
    restarted.

    If you see an error, go back and check the `/etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.conf.lua` file to ensure 
    that there are no mistakes.

### Adding the new node to the load balancer

After you have confirmed that the new server is receiving content, you can add it to the 
stack load balancer.

1. Go back to the Orchestrations page in the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com), 
   and select your stack again.

2. In the Infrastructure list, click the link for your stack's load balancer.

3. In the Nodes section of the load balancer details page, click Add Cloud Servers.

4. From the list of servers, select the checkbox next to the server that you just created, 
   and click Add Selected Servers at the bottom of the page.

After your node is added to the load balancer, you are done. You can repeat these steps as 
needed to add more nodes.
