### Summary ###

`OS::Heat::SwiftSignal` can be used to coordinate resource creation with
notifications/signals that could be coming from sources external or
internal to the stack. It is often used in conjunction with
`OS::Heat::SwiftSignalHandle` resource.

`SwiftSignalHandle` is used to create a temporary URL, and this URL is
used by applications and scripts to send signals. `SwiftSignal` resource
waits on this URL for a specified number of signals in a given time.



### Example template ###

In the following example template, you will set up a single node Linux
server that signals success or failure of `user_data` script execution
at a given URL.

Start by adding the top-level template sections:

### Resources section ###

#### Add a `SwiftSignalHandle` resource ####

`SwiftSignalHandle` is a resource to create a temporary URL to receive
notification/signals. Note that the temporary URL is created using
Rackspace Cloud Files.


    signal_handle:
      type: "OS::Heat::SwiftSignalHandle"

#### Add `SwiftSignal` resource ####

The `SwiftSignal` resource waits for a specified number of "SUCCESS"
signals (the number is provided as `count` property) on the given URL
(`handle` property). The stack will be marked as a failure if the
specified number of signals are not received in the given `timeout`, or
if a non "SUCCESS" signal is received such as a "FAILURE". A data string
and a reason string may be attached along with the success or failure
notification. The data string is an attribute that can be displayed as
template output.

    wait_on_server:
      type: OS::Heat::SwiftSignal
      properties:
        handle: {get_resource: signal_handle}
        count: 1
        timeout: 600

Here `SwiftSignal` resource would wait for `600` seconds to receive 1
signal on the `handle`.


#### Add a server resource ####

Add a Linux server with a bash script in the `user_data` property. At
the end of the script execution, send a success/failure message to the
temporary URL created by the above `SwiftSignalHandle` resource.

              sleep 300

              # Assuming long running operation completed successfully,
              # notify success signal
              wc_notify --data-binary '{"status": "SUCCESS", "data": "Script execution succeeded"}'

              # Alternatively if operation fails, a FAILURE with reason and data may be sent,
              # notify failure signal example below
              # wc_notify --data-binary '{"status": "FAILURE", "reason":"Operation failed due to xyz error", "data":"Script execution failed"}'

            params:
              # Replace all occurances of "wc_notify" in the script with an
              # appropriate curl PUT request using the "curl_cli" attribute
              # of the SwiftSignalHandle resource
              wc_notify: { get_attr: ['signal_handle', 'curl_cli']

### Outputs section ###

Add Swift signal URL to the `outputs` section.

    #Get the signal URL which contains all information passed to the signal handle
    signal_url:
      value: { get_attr: ['wait_handle', 'curl_cli'] }
      description: Swift signal URL

    #Obtain data describing script results. If nothing is passed, this value will be NULL
    signal_data:
      value: { get_attr: ['wait_on_server', 'data'] }
      description: Data describing script results

    #Obtain IPv4 address of server
    server_public_ip:
      value:{ get_attr: [ linux_server, accessIPv4 ] }
      description: Linux server public IP
