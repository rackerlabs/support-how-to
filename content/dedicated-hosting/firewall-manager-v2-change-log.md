Firewall Manager v2 is a new tool within the MyRackspace portal. This article describes the change log feature within this tool.

To learn more about the [Firewall Manager v2](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/firewall-manager-v2).

### What is the change log?

Firewall Manager v2 has a change log feature built for documentation and auditing purposes. The change log documents the events that have been executed on your Cisco firewall through the Firewall Manager tool. Only changes executed through the Firewall Manager interface are logged. Changes that are executed by Network Security Rackers who connect to the device directly are not logged in this utility.

**Note:** If you would like to identify when or if changes have occurred to any of your platforms, please open a support ticket and a Network Security Racker will complete this task for you.

Create defines that an configuration such as an object-group or port-group has been created. Delete defines that an object was removed from an object-group or port-group.
