Creating a Cloud Queue can be accomplished through the Control Panel or
through your terminal.  After creating the Queue, you can use the
Control Panel for viewing Queue details or deleting the Queue as
needed.  All other Queue commands will be completed through the
terminal.

**Note**: Be sure to [set up your authentication
token](/how-to/cloud-queues-curl-cookbook)
before completing the terminal steps for creating your cloud queue.

### Creating the queue from the Control Panel

-   In the Queues tab of the Control Panel, click **Create Queue**.
-   In the pop out box, enter a name for your queue, select your
    preferred region and click **Create Queue**. (We are using
    "samplequeue" for our example queue name throughout these steps.)

When the queue is finished building, you will see the details for your
queue listed in the Control Panel. You will then need to complete the
steps under [Testing Your
Queue](/how-to/cloud-queues-curl-cookbook)
in your terminal to begin posting messages to your Queue.

### Creating the queue from your terminal

You can create a queue from your terminal by submitting a request to the Rackspace Cloud Queues API. You need to provide the following values in your request:
[``$TOKEN`` - valid Rackspace Cloud authentication token](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-queues/v1/developer-guide/#document-getting-started/authenticate) and ``$ENDPOINT`` -  the Cloud Queues API endpoint returned in the service catalog.

Open your terminal, then submit the following cURL command to create the queue using the Cloud Queues API: Enter the followi

<!-- -->

        $ curl -i -X PUT https://$ENDPOINT:443/v1/queues/samplequeue -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"

-   Watch for the following response:

<!-- -->

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 140 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Location: /v1/queues {"queues": [{"href": "/v1/queues/samplequeue", "name": "samplequeue"}], "links": [{"href": "/v1/queues?marker=samplequeue", "rel": "next"}]}

### Testing your queue

-   You can test your queue by posting a message to it:

<!-- -->

           $ curl -i -X POST https://$ENDPOINT:443/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages -d '
        [{"ttl": 300, "body": {"event": "one"}}]
        ' -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Client-ID: e58668fc-26eb-11e3-8270-5b3128d43830" -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"

-   Watch for the following response to your test post:

<!-- -->

            HTTP/1.1 201 Created
        Content-Length: 93
        Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
        Location: /v1/queues/samplequeue/51e840b61d10b20570d56ff4

        {"partial": false, "resources": ["/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages/51e840b61d10b20570d56ff4"]}

You have now created a Cloud Queue.
