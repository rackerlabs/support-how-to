Setting up a Publisher-Subscriber model in Cloud Queues consists of posting messages to 
your queue and listing messages from your. 

The publisher-subscriber model has the following characteristics:

-   All subscribers listen to the messages in the queue.
-   Messages are not claimed.
-   Subscribers can send a marker or cursor to skip messages already seen.
-   TTL deletes messages eventually.
-   Ideal model for sending event notifications to multiple listeners at once.

### Posting messages to queue

Queues support posting 10 messages at the same time, so lets try to post
two within the same request.

#### Request

        $ curl -i -X POST https://$ENDPOINT:443/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages \
           -d ' [{"ttl": 300, "body": {"event": "two"}}, {"ttl": 60, "body": {"event": "three"}}]'\
           -H "Content-type: application/json" \
           -H "Client-ID: e58668fc-26eb-11e3-8270-5b3128d43830" \
           -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"

#### Response

        HTTP/1.1 201 Created     
        Content-Length: 153     
        Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8     
        Location: /v1/queues/samplequeue/messages?ids=51e840e71d10b2055fd565fb,51e840e71d10b2055fd565fc 
        
        {
           "partial": false, 
           "resources": [
              "/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages/51e840e71d10b2055fd565fb", 
              "/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages/51e840e71d10b2055fd565fc"
           ]
        }

In the response, you can see that the API returned two ids. You can minimize the impact of 
network latency on overall performance of Cloud Queues by posting messages in batches instead 
of posting one at a time.

### Listing messages from your queue

You can generate the list of messages from your queue by submitting the following API 
request from your terminal.

        $ curl -i -X GET https://$ENDPOINT:443/v1/queues -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN"

The API response returned lists the queues in the following format:

<!-- -->

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK     
        Content-Length: 140     
        Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8     
        Content-Location: /v1/queues  
        {
           "queues":[
               {
                   "href": "/v1/queues/samplequeue", 
                   "name": "samplequeue"
                }
            ], 
           "links":[
              {
                 "href": "/v1/queues?marker=samplequeue", 
                 "rel": "next"
                 }
           ]
        }

To avoid getting messages the subscriber has already read, use marker semantics in your 
API request, for example  ``/v1/queues/{queue_name}/messages?marker=63`. (You can retrieve 
messages with the marker by following the URLs in the links section of the JSON response).
