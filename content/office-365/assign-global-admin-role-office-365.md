Organizations with multiple administrators may need to have more than one account with the Global Administrator role in Office 365. A Global Administrator account is required to access the [Office 365 Control Panel](https://office365.cp.rackspace.com). Global Administrators have almost unlimited access to your organizations settings and most of the data.

**Note:** Each Office 365 account is created with a default administrator account with the Global Administrator role. Credentials for the default administrator account are sent to the email address provided during the sign-up for Office 365 services.

### Assign the Global Administrator role to a user

Use the following steps to assign the Global Administrator role to a user:

1.	Login to your [Office 365 Control Panel](https://office365.cp.rackspace.com).

2.	From the left menu, select **Users**.

3.	Find the user you wish to assign the role to and select **Manage**.

4.	Select **Edit Username**.

5.	Under **Role**, select **Global Administrator** from the drop-down menu.

6.	Select **Save**.

7.	Your user now has the Global Administrator role assigned to their account.

**Warning:** Microsoft warns that having more than 4 Global Administrators on an account is a security threat.

### Securing your Global Administrator account

As an administrator of your company’s email solution, you have a great deal of control over your account. If your administrator access is compromised, the results can be devastating to your business. A strong security policy is not complete without enabling multi-factor authentication. See [Manage multi-factor authentication for users in Office 365](/how-to/manage-multi-factor-authentication-for-users-in-office-365).
