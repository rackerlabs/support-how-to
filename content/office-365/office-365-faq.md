### Getting started

#### Where do I access my Office 365 account?

You access your account from two different locations:

-   You manage your Microsoft&reg; Office 365&reg; services at
    [portal.office.com](http://portal.office.com). From here you can
    create new users and work with Microsoft Exchange, Skype&reg; for Business,
    SharePoint&reg;, Yammer&reg;, and the rest of the Office 365 suite.
-   You manage your Office 365 Rackspace account at either
    [my.rackspace.com](http://my.rackspace.com) or
    [cp.rackspace.com](http://cp.rackspace.com). Use these portals to
    handle account administration, open chat support, create support
    tickets, and pay your bill.

#### What are the system requirements to run Office 365?

You can find up-to-date system requirements for Office 365 on the
[Microsoft support
website](https://products.office.com/en-US/office-system-requirements/#Office365forBEG).

#### Do I need to have an installed email client to use Office 365?

No, you don't need a stand-alone email client to use Office 365. However, many
Office 365 plans have the option of using an Office suite, which would
include Outlook. We recommend that you use the most up-to-date version
of Outlook to ensure the most complete experience.

To learn about the features that Office 365 supports, see the [Outlook help
center](https://support.office.com/en-us/outlook).

#### Does Office 365 support IMAP, POP, and SMTP connections?

Yes. You can use IMAP and SMTP connections instead of the default MAPI-based
connection that comes with Office 365.

**Note**: Using an IMAP or SMTP connection reduces functionality outside of
your email program.

#### What ports does Office 365 use for IMAP, POP, and SMTP connections?

Office 365 uses the following ports:

**IMAP**

- Incoming server: outlook.office365.com
- Port: 993

**POP**

- Incoming server: outlook.office365.com
- Port: 995

**SMTP**

- Outgoing server: smtp.office365.com
- Port: 587

#### What information do I need to provide to get started?

You need to provide the following information when you sign up for Office
365:

-   Your custom domain.
-   Your domain name registrar login and password.
-   Your domain name server (DNS) hosting provider login and password.

     Your DNS records are usually managed by the registrar from which you
     bought your domain name, but sometimes a different company manages the
     DNS records. If you don't know where your domain is registered or where
     the DNS records for your domain are managed, you
     can use a [WHOIS
     search](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-your-domain-registrar-or-DNS-hosting-provider-b5b633ba-1e56-4a98-8ff5-2acaac63a5c8?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)
    to find the information that you need.
-   A list of people to add to Office 365.

     Unless you're the only person in your company, you will want to add
     other people to Office 365 so that they can use the service. If you're
     working with our [onboarding and migrations
     team](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/migration), this process is
     covered during the migration process.

#### Can I add my domain to Office 365?

Yes. You can find instructions about how to add your domain on the [Office 365
support
website](https://support.office.com/en-za/article/Verify-your-domain-in-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611?ui=en-US&rs=en-ZA&ad=ZA).

#### What administrative centers exist for Office 365?

The following administration centers are available for Office 365:

-   [The Office 365 admin
    center](https://support.office.com/en-za/article/About-the-Office-365-admin-center-58537702-d421-4d02-8141-e128e3703547?ui=en-US&rs=en-ZA&ad=ZA&fromAR=1)
