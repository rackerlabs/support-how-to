Cool gateway to programming

I had to keep going back since there was no pause button but easy, 10 min training that helps anyone get started with contributing to support/how to articles.
Consideration for how people will come across this training; a lot of people will come from the one.rackspace wiki. Having links to this GitHub page along with next-steps on what to do to gain access (go to this GitHub proj and watch the training video, etc)
Finally can update all this out of date documentation
no

Video should be a bit slower or provide download slides
**Answer options**
