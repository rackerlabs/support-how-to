#### Identify suspicious email

Suspicious email is a gray area between legitimate email and spam. Webmail employs Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)-based indicators to determine if a message is suspicious. However, there are also several items you can see that indicate if an email message is legitimate. These indicators are simple but extremely valuable in determining the validity of a message.

First, messages that are deemed suspicious show a yellow warning banner in Webmail's message preview. The intent of this banner is to encourage you to confirm the legitimacy of the sender and the contents of the message before clicking on any links, downloading any attachments, or replying to the message. Even if the suspicious banner is not present, Webmail displays important information about the message that you can use to inspect its validity. The information is displayed for every message, and is easy to scan when you know what to look for.

Second, Webmail clearly displays the friendly name and email address of the sender. Comparing the name to the email address is a simple way to check for display name spoofing. Display name spoofing is when bad guys put a name that you recognize in the **From** address, such as the name of your manager, but the associated email address is not for that person. For example, Webmail shows you "From: John Doe <sally@notmycompanydomain.com>." Assuming John Doe is your manager's name, sally@notmycompanydomain.com is definitely not your manager's email address. In this case, the bad guy is using a compromised mailbox on another system to pose as your manager.

Finally, Webmail tells you if the domain of the sender does not match the domain used to send the message. The domain that sent the message is represented by the **'sent from'** added to the sender's address. In some cases, this situation is normal for sending services that are used for marketing and sales campaigns, newsletters, and similar email distributions. However, it can also be an indication of spoofing. Building on the previous example, if the same bad guy has compromised a Gmail mailbox and is sending email pretending to be your manager, it appears in Webmail as "From: John Doe <john.doe@mycompany.com> sent from gmail.com." Assuming your manager never uses Gmail for work purposes, this is a clear indicator that the message is suspicious.

The suspicious message banner, the full **From:** name and email address and the **sent from** domain help you ensure that the messages you interact with are from the senders that you expect. Additionally, it is always a best practice to verify any request for personal information or money that is received through email.
