You use the account section of the Cloud Office Control Panel to
directly update and manage your account, including billing info, company
contacts, administrators, upgrades, and cancellations. You access this section by clicking your account name in the top-right corner of the control panel and selecting the appropriate item from the menu.

### Company and billing details

When needed, you can change your company phone number, address, credit
card information, and contacts. You can assign primary or secondary
status to company contacts. Primary contacts have the authority to make
decisions for the account. Secondary contacts can be set up to receive
notifications such as billing statements, product updates, or system
alerts. You can also cancel services or the entire account.

### Administrator management

You can add multiple administrators with varying degrees of account
access. There are Super, Standard, and Limited administrators. Limited
administrators have access only to specifically assigned sections of the
control panel. You can also monitor and export logs of all administrator
logins and actions.
