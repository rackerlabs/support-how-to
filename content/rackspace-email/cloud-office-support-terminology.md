This article defines Cloud Office support article prerequisites and common Cloud Office support terminology.

### Cloud Office support article prerequisites

Cloud Office support articles provide one or more of the following prerequisites to describe the parameters of the article.

Prerequisite | Definition | Values or examples
--- | --- | ---
**Applies to** | Specifies the audience of the article, either User, Administrator, or both.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> An article that applies to a User can also be valuable information for an Administator. | **User**: In the context of support, a user has access to our product (for example, apps.rackspace.com), but does not have access to administrator tools (for example, the Cloud Office Control Panel). Articles that specify users as the audience do not make recommendations that require administrator tools<br/><br/>**Administrator**: The article discusses a topic that might require access to administrator tools (for example, the Cloud Office Control Panel).
**Difficulty** | A subjective evaluation of the difficulty of completing the task in the article. | **Easy**: The article is instructional and involves minimal or no troubleshooting.<br/><br/>**Moderate**: The article is instructional but requires troubleshooting or access to tools that are not part of Rackspace Cloud Office. For example, you are configuring your DNS records, your DNS is hosted at GoDaddy, and you need to access your GoDaddy account.<br/><br/>**Challenging**: The article is almost entirely troubleshooting.
**Time needed** | Approximate time needed to complete the steps in the article if you have access to all the required tools and do not encounter any unforeseen obstacles. | Examples of unforeseen obstacles:<br/><br/>- Password recovery<br/>- Internet connectivity issues<br/>- Local network configuration<br/>- Third-party application troubleshooting
**Required tools** | The minimum tools required to complete the steps in the article. Required tools can refer to level of access, software, or additional hardware. | Examples of required tools:<br/><br/>- Offending device: The device that is experiencing an issue<br/>- Non-primary computer: A computer different from the one on which you are experiencing issues<br/>- Non-primary internet network: An internet network different from the one on which you are experiencing issues<br/>- Access to multiple computers or mobile devices for troubleshooting<br/>- Access to your email account
