If you are an Android mobile phone user, you might sometimes experience problems sending outgoing email, and attempts to reconnect to the outgoing server result in the following error message:

`Unable to connect to email server to verify you account information. No response from server.`

The procedure in this article was created by the Rackspace Technical Community team as a temporary solution to this issue. We are working to create a more permanent solution.

**Note:** The procedure might be different for each Android mobile phone. The instructions in this article were created using a Galaxy Note 3.

### Access Point Name

The Access Point Name (APN) is a gateway between a GPRS, 3G, or 4G mobile network and another computer network that runs on many Android devices. The outgoing email problem on Android phones occurs because the APN, which for T-Mobile is `fast.t-mobile.com`, is set to use IPv6 only and does not allow the outbound email server to respond. This in turn keeps emails on Android phones in the outbox until it connects to a Wi-Fi network. The default APN doesn't roll back to IPv4, so the SMTP connection cannot be made. The way to fix this is to add a new APN that does roll back to IPv4.

### Before you add a new APN

Ensure that your Android mobile phone meets the following requirements:

- It has the latest Android OS using POP3.
- The SMTP server, security type, and port are all entered correctly.
- It can establish a connection with the incoming server.

Additionally, confirm that the email settings on your Android phone match the following settings:

- **Incoming:** secure.emailsrvr.com. Use SSL port 995.

- **Require Auth:** Username (Full Email Address) and password.

- **Outgoing:** secure.emailsrvr.com. Use SSL port 465.

- **Require Auth:** Username (Full Email Address) and password.

### Add a new APN

1. On your phone, navigate to **Settings > More Networks**.

2. Go to **Mobile Networks > Access Point Names**.

    Only one APN should be listed.

3. To add another APN, tap the **&#43;** symbol and specify the following settings only:

    - **Name:** Fast

    - **SPN:** fast.t-mobile.com

    - **APN Protocol:** IPv4/IPv6

4. Select the new APN.
