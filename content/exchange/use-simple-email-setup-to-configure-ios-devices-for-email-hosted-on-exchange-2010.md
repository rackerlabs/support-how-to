This article describes how to use our Simple Email
setup tool in Outlook Web Access (OWA) to set up your iPhone.

**Note:** These instructions apply to customers on a Microsoft Exchange
2010 environment. If you are unsure about what Exchange platform you are
using, contact your administrator.

### Set up email on iPhone

1. Log in to
   [connect.emailsrvr.com](http://connect.emailsrvr.com) with your email
   address and password.

2. In the top right hand corner, select **Options** and then select
   **See All Options**.

   On the next screen, select **Setup your iPhone**
   under **Shortcuts to things you can do**

   and select **Send**.

4. You'll receive a text message with a link.
   Click that link.

   Select **Install** and then select **Install now**.

   On the next screen, enter the password for your email address.

   <img src="{% asset_path exchange/use-simple-email-setup-to-configure-ios-devices-for-email-hosted-on-exchange-2010/iPhone4.png %}" class="image-quarter_width" />

   **Note:** if you have the passcode protection on your phone, you may
   receive a passcode notification to confirm the installation.

5. Your phone will begin the verification process and you'll receive a
   **Verified** notification when that process is complete.

   Wait for the process to complete. Then select **Done**.

   At this point, your email account begins syncing your mailbox
   from the server on your phone. The time required for this process can vary
   depending on your connection speed and how many days of mail is syncing.
