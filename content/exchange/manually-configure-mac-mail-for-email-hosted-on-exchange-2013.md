This article describes how to set up your Microsoft Exchange 2013
email account with Mac Mail.

**Note:** Exchange 2013 only runs with the 10.6 or higher OS (operating
system). To see what OS you're running, select the
**Apple** icon located in the top left hand corner and then **About This
Mac**.

1. Open Mac Mail and select **File** and then **Add Account**.

2. On the next screen, enter your full name, entire email address,
   and password. Click **Continue**.

3. Enter the following information into the fields:

   - Account Type - Select **Exchange**.

   - Description - Enter a descriptive name of your choice for
     your mail account (for example, Work Mail).

   - Incoming mail server - In the **Server address** field,
     enter the value you find for this in
     your control panel at
     cp.rackspace.com (for Admins) or User Control Panel at
     cp.rackspace.com/usercp.
     At either control panel, look for the incoming mail Server
     in the **Client Setup** section.

   - User Name - Enter your entire email address
     (for example, myname@example.com).

   - Password - Enter the password associated with the email
     account you are setting up.

   **Note:** The Address Book and iCal Calendar auto setup features
   are optional.

   - Click the **Continue** button, and then click the
     **Create** button. Your account will then connect and mail data
     will begin to populate into your inbox.
