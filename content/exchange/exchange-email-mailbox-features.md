Rackspace offers a Hosted Exchange solution for users who require a
collaborative solution for their business/organization.

You can use Hosted Exchange to work with distribution lists
and with the Outlook Web App (OWA).

### Exchange Distribution Lists

You can use lists, also called Exchange Distribution Lists, to manage users
in a team or group. Only email addresses in your domain can be
part of a distribution list.

For example, you can create a distribution list to group together everyone on
the billing team: bob@example.com, amy@example.com, and
scott@example.com. Adding all members of the billing team to one distribution
list makes it possible to communicate new upcoming billing updates
within the team by writing to one address, such as billingupdates@example.com.

To set up a list, log into the Cloud Office Control Panel
[here](https://cp.rackspace.com/Exchange/Mail/Lists/).

### Outlook Web App (OWA)

The Outlook Web App is a direct connection to your email without the
need for additional software; your web browser is enough.
Messages that are sent and received using OWA will be
waiting for you the next time you log into the portal. The OWA portal
provides most of the functionality that a mail client would offer, including
sending and receiving email, setting up email signatures, and setting
rules to filter messages to sub-folders.

#### Advantages of OWA versus email clients

- There is no need to configure additional server settings for OWA.
- Email is ready to access 24/7 through the most popular web browsers
  (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google
  Chrome, Safari)
- Messages are stored in the cloud so no local storage is consumed.
- Changes made to Contacts, Calendar and Mail items are synced down to
  all other devices configured with your account.

#### Accessing OWA
