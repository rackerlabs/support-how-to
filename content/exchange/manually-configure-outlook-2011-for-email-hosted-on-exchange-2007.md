This article describes how to set up your
Microsoft Exchange 2007 mailbox
to work with your
Microsoft Outlook 2011 email client.


1\. First thing you'll want to do is login to your usercp
([cp.rackspace.com/usercp](http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp)) and under
the **Client Setup** section, and select **Outlook 2011**. This will
contain some information that we'll need to set up your account; for now
let's set this aside and we'll come back to this in a bit.

2\. Next, we'll open up Outlook and from the Outlook drop-down menu,
select **Preferences**. In the Outlook Preferences menu,
select **Accounts**.

5\. Select **Add Account,** and confirm that Amber dot next to the
account name turns from an amber color to a solid green (this may take a
moment). Close all windows and you're done!

*Note:* *The amber dot may take a minute or two to change from amber to
green; If it doesn't, check the accounts settings and password and make
sure you're using the correct EWS server address.* *Note: If you already
have email on the server, your email will slowly begin to populate your
inbox. This can take some time dependning on how much data you have.*
