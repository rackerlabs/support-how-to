### Metrics

#### What can I use Rackspace Metrics for?

You can use Rackspace Metrics to ingest metrics and to retrieve and
visualize these metrics. Rackspace Metrics features two APIs: the Query
API and the Ingestion API. The Query API enables users to retrieve
metrics data from the database. Through the Query API, Rackspace Metrics
also supports metrics visualization in the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel
and Rackspace Intelligence for data collected through Cloud Monitoring.
The Ingestion API enables users to ingest metrics via a public API. The
Metrics Ingestion API is currently in the [Early Access
Program](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/developer-guide/#document-overview/early-access-program)
(EAP).

#### Who can use Rackspace Metrics?

All Rackspace customers with a Cloud services account can use the
Rackspace Metrics Query API. To use the Rackspace Metrics Ingestion API,
you need to sign up for the service through the [Early Access
Program](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/developer-guide/#document-overview/early-access-program).

#### How do I grant access to Rackspace Metrics?

For information about how to add Rackspace Metrics to individual users
on your Cloud account, see [Rackspace Metrics
Overview](/how-to/rackspace-metrics-overview).

#### What features will be available in the future?

We plan to provide the following features in future releases:

 - **Available in GA** - Access to Rackspace Intelligence for Rackspace
 Dedicated customers: Provides the ability for Dedicated customers to also
 access Rackspace Intelligence for their devices.

 - **Available in Future** - Customizable dashboards: Provides the ability to
 customize your dashboard in Rackspace Intelligence by adding widgets for
 graphs, drag-and-drop widgets, and more.

#### Where is Rackspace Metrics available?

Rackspace Metrics is available through global end points that can be
accessed from anywhere. For more information, see the [Service access
endpoints](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/developer-guide/#service-access-endpoints)
section in the [Rackspace Metrics Developer
Guide](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/developer-guide/#developer-guide).

#### What is the Early Access Program?

The Early Access Program lets customers use and give feedback on our
products before a final version is released. This program ensures that
our features align with customer business needs. Additional features
will be added as development continues, and some existing functionality
available during Early Access might change.

### Account services

#### What are the Terms of Service?

During the Early Access period, the Rackspace Metrics Terms of Service
are available at <http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/testterms>.
When the Early Access Program is over, the Terms of Service will revert
to the standard Cloud Terms of Service.

#### How much does Rackspace Metrics cost?

Rackspace Metrics is free for all Rackspace customers with Cloud or Dedicated accounts during the EAP. The UA launch date and pricing will be determined this year.

#### How can I get support?
