**Applies to**: RackConnect v3.0

**Important**: The beginning of each RackConnect article now includes an
**Applies to** label to indicate whether the contents apply to
RackConnect v3.0, RackConnect v2.0, or both.

RackConnect v3.0 is the latest release of our
innovative hybrid connectivity offering that enables you to select and
combine the best features of our dedicated and cloud hosting offerings
into one all-encompassing solution. With version 3.0, you can design
your computing environment to take advantage of the latest benefits in
cloud computing&mdash;flexibility, scalability, and elasticity&mdash;with the
benefits of traditional dedicated hosting&mdash;enhanced security and
performance characteristics. RackConnect is compatible with our
dedicated [Managed and Intensive service
levels](http://www.rackspace.com/dedicated-servers/service-levels/) and
our cloud [Managed Operations and Managed
Infrastructure](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/compare-service-levels) service levels,
giving you the ability to select the level of ***Fanatical Support***<sup>&reg;</sup> that you need to properly manage your hybrid environment.

RackConnect provides an isolated path for network traffic to traverse
between your cloud and dedicated environments located within the same
region. To accomplish this, RackConnect relies on Rackspace Cloud
Networks on the cloud side and dedicated network devices on the
dedicated side of your environment. For a basic introduction to Cloud
Networks, see [Getting Started with Cloud
Networks](/how-to/cloud-networks).
For a complete list of dedicated network devices currently supported by
RackConnect, see [RackConnect network device comparison](/how-to/rackconnect-network-device-comparison).
