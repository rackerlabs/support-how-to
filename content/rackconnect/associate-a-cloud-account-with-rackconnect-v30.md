**Applies to:** RackConnect v3.0

RackConnect v3.0 is a hybrid offering that provides network connectivity
between your dedicated and cloud environments. By default, you can
manage your dedicated environment within the
[MyRackspace portal](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list),
but you cannot manage any of your cloud environments. To perform some
cloud account administration tasks from the MyRackspace portal, you must
*link* your cloud accounts with your dedicated account.

A RackConnect v3.0 *configuration* represents a single deployment of a
RackConnect solution. A configuration is normally associated with one or
more cloud accounts. For more information about configurations, see
[RackConnect key
terms](/how-to/rackconnect-key-terms).

After you link your cloud accounts with your dedicated account, you can then *associate* a cloud account with a particular RackConnect v3.0
configuration from within the MyRackspace portal. After you associate a cloud account with a configurations, a ticket is automatically generated for us, and we will work with you to fully configure the cloud account for use with RackConnect v3.0. See the [RackConnect v3.0 requirements](/how-to/rackconnect-v30-requirements) article for more details.

The following sections provide steps for linking and associating a cloud account.

### Create a new cloud account or link an existing account

1.  In the
    [MyRackspace portal](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list), navigate to **Products &gt; Rackspace Cloud**.

    The **Link Cloud Account** and **Create Cloud Account** options are
    near the top of the screen.

2.  Click the appropriate option, and follow the guide to complete the
    process.

### Associate a cloud account with a RackConnect v3.0 configuration

1.  Ensure that you have already linked a cloud account to your
    dedicated account. You can verify this from the
    [MyRackspace portal](https://my.rackspace.com/portal/cloudAccount/list)
    by navigating to **Products &gt; Rackspace Cloud**. Your
    linked cloud account's details are displayed on the right-hand pane
    of the screen.

2.  After you have linked a cloud account, you can click the plus
    sign (+) under the **RackConnect** column to associate a cloud account
    with one of your RackConnect configurations. In most cases, you have
    only one RackConnect configuration.
