**Applies to**: RackConnect v3.0

RackConnect v3.0 includes an enhanced API that lets you accomplish the
following tasks:

-   Seamlessly add and remove cloud servers from your load balancer
    pools
-   List your available load-balancer pools
-   Add and remove public IP addresses from your cloud servers
-   List your public IP addresses
-   List the cloud networks associated with your RackConnect
    configuration

RackConnect is based on and requires Rackspace Cloud Networks for
cloud-side connectivity. Because of this, RackConnect is compatible only
with the same types of cloud servers that Cloud Networks supports.

RackConnect has configuration options that can greatly improve security
for your cloud servers environment, including support for servers built
with only a single network interface connected to an isolated cloud
network. You can choose to create a truly isolated and secure cloud
servers environment that has connectivity only with other servers on the
same isolated network, or you can allow network access to your dedicated
networks or the Internet. To further increase the security of your
RackConnect environment, you also have the ability to use the Rackspace
dedicated intrusion detection system (IDS) and web application firewall
(WAF) offerings.

RackConnect is also compatible with our dedicated [Managed and
Intensive](http://www.rackspace.com/dedicated-servers/service-levels) service
levels and our cloud [Managed Operations and Managed
Infrastructure](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/compare-service-levels) service levels,
giving you the ability to select the level of ***Fanatical Support***<sup>&reg;</sup> that
you need to properly manage your hybrid environment.

If you have questions, reach out to us. Our contact information
is available on the [Contact Us](/how-to/support) page.
