When you have decide that Rackspace Fanatical Support&reg; is for you, it's time to sign up for a Rackspace account. Although the signup process is straightforward, it’s important to understand some details about the verification process and account ownership before you start.

### Before you sign up

Before you sign up for a Rackspace account, answer the following questions:

**Which cloud or Rackspace product are you using?**

Rackspace supports several different clouds, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), in
addition to its own suite of cloud products, including Rackspace Public Cloud. The
signup process depends on what product or service you want to use. This article
provides instructions for the following products and services:

-	[Fanatical Support for AWS and Rackspace Public Cloud](#fanatical-support-for-aws-or-rackspace-public-cloud)
-	[Rackspace Email and applications](#rackspace-email-and-applications)
-	[Office 365](#office-365)

**Who will be the primary user or account owner?**

The information provided to Rackspace during the signup process is associated with the
primary user of the account. The primary user is the owner of the account and has the
ability to add and remove additional users, set permissions, and view or change billing
information. In addition, the primary user is the main point of contact for the account.
For example, any user can create a support ticket, but only the account owner is notified
when a support ticket is created, updated, or marked as solved.

If the account is for a business or organization, Rackspace recommends creating a username that is specific to your company.

**Is your signup information accurate?**

Our security precautions start with the signup process. We employ a series of industry standard, enterprise-class tools to help verify and validate all account requests as quickly as possible. Additionally, we have a global team that manages the signup and validation process 24x7x365, and calls customers to verify information within minutes of receiving applications. The most common delay in this process is caused by receiving inaccurate contact information from new customers.

You can ensure the quick processing of your account by verifying that all of the information that you provide is accurate. Rackspace uses the following information to create your account:

- Email address
- Unique username 
- Password (8 to 19 characters with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number)
- Security question and answer
- First and last name of primary account owner
- Company or Organization (optional)
- Physical address
- Phone number
- Valid credit card
