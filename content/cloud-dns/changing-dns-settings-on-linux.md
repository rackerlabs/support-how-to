There may be times you need to change your server's DNS settings, either
because you find they're misconfigured or because you want to use your
own. Fortunately, there isn't a lot of work involved in changing the
[DNS servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/dns/), just a quick edit in the
right place.

### Add name servers to the config file

On Linux, the DNS servers the system uses for name resolution are defined
in the file:

    /etc/resolv.conf

In that file, you should have at least one `nameserver` line (two is
better, so you have a fallback). Each line defines a DNS server.

The name servers are prioritized in the order the system finds them
in the file. Use the IP addresses of the name servers when entering
them, since the system won't know what to do with domain names until
after it knows how to get to the DNS servers.

Open **resolv.conf** with an editor, such as `nano`, to make the necessary changes
(if it doesn't exist already, this command creates the file):

    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

The following table displays which name server IP addresses to use depending on which datacenter houses your cloud servers:

| Datacenter | Name server IP |
|---|---|
| Hong Kong (HKG) | nameserver 120.136.32.63 <br /> nameserver 120.136.32.62 |
| London (LON) | nameserver 83.138.151.80 <br /> nameserver 83.138.151.81 |
| Chicago (ORD) | nameserver 173.203.4.8 <br /> nameserver 173.203.4.9 |
| Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) | nameserver 73.3.128.240 <br /> nameserver 72.3.128.241 |
| Sydney (SYD) | nameserver 119.9.60.63 <br /> nameserver 119.9.60.62 |

After you have your DNS servers set, save the file.

The easiest way to make sure your new settings are working is to try to `ping` a domain name:

    ping -c 3 rackspace.com

You should see a result similar to the following:

    PING rackspace.com (173.203.44.122) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 173.203.44.122: icmp_req=1 ttl=249 time=25.3 ms
    64 bytes from 173.203.44.122: icmp_req=2 ttl=249 time=25.2 ms
    64 bytes from 173.203.44.122: icmp_req=3 ttl=249 time=25.2 ms

    --- rackspace.com ping statistics ---
    3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 25.236/25.292/25.392/0.147 ms

If you get an `unknown host` message back, you should double-check the IP
addresses you set as your DNS servers.

#### Name servers with IPv6 addresses

If you're using IPv6 on your server, you may need to add the IPv6
addresses of your name servers to **resolv.conf**. You can see if a DNS
server has an IPv6 address with two steps.

1. Use `host` to get the name of the server:

       $ host 72.3.128.240
       240.128.3.72.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer cachens1.dfw1.rackspace.com.

2. Use the domain name you got back in another `host` lookup:

       $ host cachens1.dfw1.rackspace.com
       cachens1.dfw1.rackspace.com has address 72.3.128.240
       cachens1.dfw1.rackspace.com has IPv6 address 2001:4800:d::1

If an IPv6 address is returned, you can add that as another `nameserver`
line in **resolv.conf**, as in:

    nameserver 2001:4800:d::1

Then test as previously shown, using the `ping6` command instead of the regular
`ping` command to force the system to use IPv6.
