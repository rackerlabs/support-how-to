DNS uses different record types for different purposes. This
article helps you determine which record type you should use when
creating a DNS record in the Cloud Control Panel.

#### A/AAAA

Use the A/AAAA name to point to an IP address. In simple cases, you may
have only a single A or AAAA record as your base record pointing to a
single IP address. However in most cases. you'll have several A or AAAA
records that point to different IP addresses.

**Note:** If you do have a base record (which is not actually required)
it must be an A or AAAA record. For example, you could have
`www.mydomain.com` as an A record that points to 1.2.3.4, and
`www.domain.com` might be a CNAME record that points
to `www.myotherimportantdomain.com`.  Likewise, you might have
a `mail.domain.com` record pointing to 5.6.7.8.

A is an IPv4 Address record.

AAAA is an IPv6 Address record. Use this record type only if your server
has an IPv6 address to point to.

#### CNAME

Use the Common Name (CNAME) record to point to another record.

#### MX

Use the Mail Exchange (MX) record for mail delivery. For
example, creating an MX record for domain.com would allow you to set up
an email address like `mailto:mike@domain.com`.

#### NS

Use the Name Server (NS) record to delegate an authoritative DNS server
for a domain or subdomain.

#### SRV

Use the Server Locator record to designate a host and port for certain
services, such as LDAP,  for a domain.

#### TXT

Use the Text (TXT) record to store data types such as SPF or DKIM
records.
