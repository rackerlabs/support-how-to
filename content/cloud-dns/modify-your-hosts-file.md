Modifying your **hosts** file enables you to override the domain name system
(DNS) for a domain on a specific machine. This process is useful when you
want to perform the following tasks:

- Test your site without the test link prior to going live with SSL.
- Verify that an alias site works prior to DNS changes.
- Work on other DNS-related tasks.

Modifying your **hosts** file causes your local machine to look directly at
the Internet Protocol (IP) address that you specify.

Modifying the hosts file involves adding two entries to it. Each entry
contains the IP address to which you want the site to resolve and a version of
the Internet address. For example, add the following two entries points,
**www.domain.com** and **domain.com**, to Rackspace's current refreshed PHP5
(PHP5-ITK) cluster:

    64.49.219.194 www.domain.com
    64.49.219.194 domain.com

This article provides instructions for locating and editing the **hosts** file
on the following operating systems:

-   Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and
    Windows Vista&trade;
-   Microsoft Windows NT&trade;, Windows 2000, and Windows XP
-   Linux&reg;
-   MacOS&reg; X versions 10.0 through 10.1.5
-   MacOS X versions 10.6 through 10.12

After you add the domain information and save the file, your system begins to
resolve to the IP address that you specified. When testing is complete, remove
these entries.
