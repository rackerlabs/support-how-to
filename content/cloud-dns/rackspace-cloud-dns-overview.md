[Cloud DNS introduction](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-dns)

Our existing DNS infrastructure is a Globally Distributed Anycast
Network. Rackspace currently has DNS servers located in Texas, Virginia,
and London. Within each datacenter, we have our nameservers split up so
that we have no single point of failure in front of our DNS servers.

Using anycast, we broadcast IP addresses from each location, which gives
us two advantages:

1.  The DNS queries will generally go to the geographically
    closest nameservers. This gives faster results no matter where the
    queries originate.
2.  If an entire datacenter were to fail, or even if all of the DNS
    servers within a specific datacenter were to fail, the DNS queries
    will automatically start going to the next best location.
