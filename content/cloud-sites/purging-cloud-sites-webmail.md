**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

**Note:** Email is no longer offered as a feature for Cloud Sites. This article
is here to support legacy customers with email accounts.

Cloud Sites webmail accounts provide 1GB of storage space. If you reach
the quota and wish to delete or purge messages in order to free up
space, you'll need to make the following changes:

1.  Log into your webmail account.

2.  Go to the webmail settings (3 lines on upper left corner).

3.  In the General Settings tab you will go to the Email Options section and deselect the following options:

  -  Move deleted email to the Trash folder
  -  Move purged email to the Trash folder

After you have saved the changes you can then delete or purge messages.
If you would like to see which folders contain the most messages you can
go to the **Folder Manager**, which is the gold button next to the Inbox.
This will provide you with the option to **Update Sizes** as well as to purge
folders.
