You can import data into and export data from your archive in Cloud
Office.

### Importing data ###

If you want to import data, create a request ticket in your control
panel and include your domain name in the request. Rackspace will gather
the necessary information and provide you with the best import method.

Cost and turnaround time both depend on how much data you want to
recover:

-   The fee for data imports is \$6 per GB of data.
-   For maximum import completion times, see [Time frames for importing
    and exporting data](#maxtime) at the end of this article.

### Exporting data ###

You can use the following methods to export your data from your
Rackspace Archiving account:

-   Export your data from the Archive Manager by creating searches and
    exporting the results of the searches. For information about how to
    export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results
    in Cloud
    Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

    **Note:** You can export searches with a maximum of 15,000
results and the total size of 3.5 GB

-   If you want to get a bulk export of your archived data, we can
    perform the export and provide you with links from which you can
    download your data directly. If you have access to an FTP site,
    provide your credentials and we can export your data to the
    FTP site.

The pricing for a bulk export is a one-time fee of \$6 per GB
for EML format and \$9 per GB for PST format.

When determining which export method to use, consider the following
questions:

**Is an external third party requesting these exports?**

Providing a temporary login for third parties to review search results
is much faster than requesting a bulk export.

**To which format do you need to export?**

We offer bulk exports in either PST or EML format. Although PST is a
more well-known format, exporting in EML tends to be easier to search,
faster for us to produce, and much cheaper. We recommend that you first
determine whether there is a preferred format. If there is no preferred
format, then we recommend using EML.

**Do you need to export all data or only data that meets certain criteria?**

In most cases, more data means a longer and more expensive export. We
can export data that meets certain criteria, such as search, date,
range, or mailbox users.

You can also provide search names based on the following criteria:

-   Date
-   Search term
-   Subject
-   Sender
-   Recipient
-   Words or attachments in the body

### Time frames for importing and exporting data ###

Following are the *maximum* completion times for both importing and
exporting:

-   5 - 25 GB in 3 weeks
-   26 - 50 GB in 4 weeks
-   51 GB - 1 TB in 5 weeks
