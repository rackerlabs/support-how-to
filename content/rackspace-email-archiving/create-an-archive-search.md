After your email data has been received and indexed, you can perform
archive searches. Nightly collections index the email and add it to the
archive. You can also run collections manually through the Archive
Manager. This article describes the steps for creating an archive search
in Cloud Office.

1\. Log in to the [Archive
    Manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f).
    For more information, see [Log in to the Archive
    Manager](/how-to/log-in-to-the-archive-manager).

2\. In the upper-right corner of the window, click **Search** to access
    the Search dashboard.

**Note:** There are three dashboards for top level administrators: **Search**, **Admin**, and **Admin User**.

3\. Click the **Search** tab.

4\. Click **Start new search**.

5\. Click the tab for the type of search and choose from four different
    search types:

-   **Simple** - Search for text in messages or attachments.

-   **Wizard** - Add conditions to the search query and inspect all
    parts of the message, including sender, recipient, subject,
    body, and attachment.

-   **Advanced** - Search by sender, recipient, subject, body, and
    attachment with greater fine-tuning control. For more
    information, see "Advanced Search" after these
    steps.

6\. Enter a name for the search.

7\. Enter any terms you wish to search for under **Search Terms**, as
    appropriate.

8\. If you wish to send alerts whenever a search is conducted, click
    **Enable Search Alerting on this search**. You can select which
    users receive the alert by their permission level (ie. if you
    select, "Search User" any user with Admin User access will receive
    an alert).

9\. You now can chose any optional parameters for the search.

-   **Dates** allows you to select when dates you want the search to
        include.

-   **Tags** assist in categorizing searches.Tags can be predefined
    under the **Settings** tab. To access predefined tags, click
    **Tags** on the **New Search** page.

-   **Legal hold** allows you to sort out results on legal hold.

-   **Note** allows you to describe the search.

10\. Click **Permissions** and designate which users can access, change
    the scope of, or export the search.

11\. To search and display results immediately, click **Save and display
    results**. To save the search and return to the list of searches,
    click **Save and return to list**.


### Advanced search ###

Sometimes your search results can be too large to sort through, and in
cases when you are looking for something specific, it is often best to
use the **Advanced Search** option. The more specific information you
give the search, the better and more accurate your results will be.

Enter as much available search information as possible in the fields
under **Search Options**.
