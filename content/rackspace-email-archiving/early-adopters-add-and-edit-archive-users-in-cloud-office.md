This article describes how to add and edit archive users.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 10 minutes
- **Tools required:** Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

After you have completed the steps in [Log in to the Archive
Manager](/how-to/log-in-to-the-archive-manager),
you can add additional users to the Archive Manager and assign the
following user types:

-   **Administrator** - Provides complete access across the archive with ability to create, modify, and export searches; manage hold reason, users, permissions, and policies.

-   **Admin Only** - Provides access to most account, user management settings and permissions but prohibits access to interaction with message data including running, editing, and exporting searches or affecting retention policies.

-   **Compliance Officer** - Provides access to interact with data across the archive in addition to creating and managing hold reasons.

-   **Search Administrator** - Provides access to create, save, edit, export, and review searches across the archive.

-   **Exporter** - Provides access to view and export the results of saved searches that have been explicitly shared with the individual user. Exporters only have access to exports that are requested by the individual user.

-   **Reviewer** - Provides access to view the results of saved searches that have been explicitly shared with the individual user. Reviewers are unable to download or send the results from the application.

-   **End User** - Provides access to **MyArchive** functionality which limits access to archived assets associated with the logged in users’ listed email address.

You can also edit an existing user to change any of the following user
settings or information:

-   Basic contact information
-   Temporary passwords
-   Permissions
-   Account Status
-   Enable/Disable Administrator(s) listed in Archive
