## Contributing to the Rackspace How-To content repository

This file describes the general process for maintaining source code for content published at [https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/).

Content is grouped into one directory per product. Each directory contains one file per article.

### Getting started with GitHub

To contribute to the How-To repository, you need a GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can sign up for one [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

#### Create a fork of this repository

Before you create a new article or make edits to an existing one, create a *fork* of the How-To repository.

1. In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button.

2. In the pop-up box, select your personal GitHub account.

A personal copy of the How-To repository is created in your GitHub account. You can access your fork by going to the [GitHub home page](https://github.com) and selecting **rackspace-how-to** under **Your repositories**.

#### Keeping your fork up to date

Because your forked copy of the repository is not live, you need to periodically update it with changes from the live repository. A status message above the latest commit activity that informs you whether your forked repository is current with the master How-To repository. If the status says `This branch is X commits behind rackerlabs:master`, update your repo by clicking the **Pull request** button to the right of the message.

**Note:** If you get a message that the rackerlabs:master branch is up-to-date with commits from your master branch, click the "switching the base" link. 

**WARNING:** To avoid any merge conflicts or difficulties when making a pull request, always check that your copy of the fork is up to date with the master repository.

### Creating and changing articles

Use the following instructions to create a new article, make edits to an existing one, or suggest edits via an issue.

#### Create an article

2. Click **New file**.

3. Enter a name for your article in the text box at the end of the **rackspace-how-to/content/*productName*/** string. The name should be in the format **your-article-name.md** and should reflect the title of the article.

4. <a name="metadata"></a>Enter header information using the format shown in the following example:

           ---
           permalink: title-of-article/
           
           title: Checking cloud status

           type: article

           created_date: '2016-01-29'

           created_by: Rosie Contreras

           last_modified_date: '2016-01-29'

           last_modified_by: Rosie Contreras

           product: Cloud Servers

           product_url: cloud-servers
           ---
5. Write your article in Markdown.

6. When you have finished writing your article, review it in the *Preview* tab.

7. Click **Propose new change**.

8. Create a pull request(PR). On the "Comparing changes" page, check the following settings:

    - `base fork: rackerlabs/rackspace-how-to`
    - `base: master`
    - `head fork: {your-username}/rackspac...`
    - `compare: {your-branch}`
    
   If the settings are not correct, use the drop down menus to select the correct settings. 

   If the settings are correct, click **Create pull request**. 

10. Describe the reasons for your change in the comment box, than select **Create pull request**.

**Note:** If your article includes images, send an email to <how-to@rackspace.com> with the image files. Note where the images belong in the article by using comments: `<!--this is a comment-->`.

Your PR will be reviewed. Depending on the review feedback, you might be asked to make additional changes. The How-To editorial team will merge your pull request once your contribution is reviewed.

#### Edit an article

Follow these steps to edit an existing article within a product folder of the **rackerlabs/rackspace-how-to** repo.

1. Go to the [Rackspace How-To content folder](https://github.com/rackerlabs/rackspace-how-to/tree/master/content) and click the product for which you want to edit an article.

2. Find the article you want to edit and click to open the file. 

3. At the top of the article, click the pencil (Edit this file) icon.

4. Make any edits to the article directly through the GitHub website.

    **Note:** If you are using a desktop client or the command line, and you are forking or cloning the repository, be sure to make your changes in a new branch. Doing so ensures that you are producing a pull request (PR) rather than committing changes directly to the master.

5. When you have finished editing the article, click **Propose file change**.

6. On the "Comparing changes" page, check the following settings:

    - `base fork: rackerlabs/rackspace-how-to`
    - `base: master`
    - `head fork: {your-username}/rackspac...`
    - `compare: {your-branch}`

   If the settings are not correct, use the drop down menus to select the correct settings. 

   If the settings are correct, click **Create pull request**.
   
7. Describe the changes that you made in a PR message.

   Use the following guidelines to create the PR message:

    - Provide a brief description of the change, starting with an imperative verb. For example, "Add a paragraph about... ."
    - If you make a complex edit, explain why you are making the edit. For example, if you are changing the formatting of an article because a list should be ordered instead of unordered, say, "Switch list in middle of article to ordered to show clear progression of steps".

8. Click **Create pull request**.

Your PR will be reviewed. Depending on the review feedback, you might be asked to make additional changes. The How-To editorial team will merge your pull request once your contribution is reviewed.

### Writing guidelines

Use the following general writing guidelines, which are described in detail in [style-guidelines.md](style-guidelines.md):

- Use sentence-style capitalization for titles and headings
- Use active voice
- Use present tense
- Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood
- Write clear and consistent step text
- Use consistent text formatting
- Clarify pronouns such as *it*, *this*, *there*, and *that*
- Clarify gerunds and participles
- Write clear and consistent code examples
- Use consistent terminology

Following are some specific guidelines for How-To content:

- For the first-level headings in an article, use the H3 level (designated by ###). Avoid using more than three levels of heading in an article (H3, H4, and H5). If you need more than three levels, you should consider breaking your article into two or more articles.

- When an article mainly provides step-by-step instructions for users to follow, begin the title of the article with an imperative verb. For example: Install the Cloud Backup agent on Windows.

- If a title contains a special character, such as a colon, enclose the title with single quotation marks.

- When code includes placeholders, show them in camelCase and enclose them in angle brackets. For example, `<hostName>`.

- To link to another article, use the following format: `[<articleName>](/how-to/<articleName>)`. For example,  `[Rackspace Email and Hosted Exchange settings](/how-to/rackspace-email-and-hosted-exchange-settings)`. Note the use of the leading slash.

- When creating complex lists, such as procedures with sublists, graphics, and code examples, use the spacing guidelines at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists.
